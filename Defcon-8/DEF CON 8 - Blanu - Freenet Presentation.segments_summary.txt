- **Introduction to Freenet**: Freenet is a distributed file-sharing network that provides anonymity and censorship resistance. It aims to protect user privacy and allow access to information without restriction.
- **Network Structure**: Freenet uses a decentralized network of nodes, where each node acts as a network itself. Information is stored and retrieved anonymously, with requests routed through multiple nodes.
- **Anonymity and Security**: Freenet employs various techniques to ensure anonymity, including cryptographic signatures, smart routing, and hops-to-live. It also addresses potential attacks such as denial-of-service, bandwidth attacks, and information-based attacks.
- **Trust and Verification**: Freenet incorporates digital signatures to build trust among users. Users can choose to trust certain signatures and filter content accordingly. However, true anonymity and trust are challenging to achieve simultaneously.
- **Node Behavior**: Nodes have unique identifiers based on hashed IP addresses. They can choose to accept or reject connections and determine the number of nodes a message propagates to. Nodes do not store information unless specifically requested.
- **Client and Node Interaction**: Clients interact with nodes to insert or request files. Communication between clients and nodes is encrypted, and nodes do not have access to decryption keys.
- **Legal Considerations**: Freenet addresses legal concerns by encrypting content within the network, making it inaccessible to nodes. However, the potential illegality of running a Freenet node is discussed.
- **Future Improvements**: The Freenet team plans to implement features such as searching, updating documents, and integrating mixed nodes for improved anonymity. They also encourage users to run nodes and contribute to the network.
