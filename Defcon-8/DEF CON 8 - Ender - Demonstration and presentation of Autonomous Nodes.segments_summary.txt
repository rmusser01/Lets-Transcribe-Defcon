## Autonomous Nodes
- Autonomous nodes are small computer programs that follow a set of rules and do not require communication with other nodes.
- They can be used for hacking, but also for network security.
- Autonomous nodes can be used to perform a single task, such as running NMAP on a machine.
- They can be programmed to perform a specific function, such as DNS poisoning.
- Autonomous nodes can be designed to work on multiple operating systems.

## Intelligent Agents
- Intelligent agents are computer programs that can make decisions and perform tasks based on their environment and user input.
- They can be used for a variety of applications, including data science, customer service, and fraud detection.
- Intelligent agents can be classified into different types, such as simple reflex agents, model-based reflex agents, and utility-based agents.
- They are often used in artificial intelligence and can be considered a type of autonomous node.
