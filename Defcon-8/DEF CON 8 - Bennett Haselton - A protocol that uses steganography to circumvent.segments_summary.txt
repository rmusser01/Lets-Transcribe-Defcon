- **Introduction to the Problem**: Alice, a user in a country with internet restrictions (e.g., China), wants to access blocked websites by communicating with Bob, who runs a server outside the country. The challenge is to design a secure communication protocol that cannot be detected or blocked by the Chinese firewall administrator, Mallory.
- **Arms Race vs. Get it Right the First Time**: The "arms race" strategy involves releasing a protocol with known weaknesses, anticipating that Mallory will eventually find and exploit them, and then releasing an updated version. The "get it right the first time" strategy aims to design a protocol that is secure from the start and cannot be detected, even if Mallory knows the details.
- **Challenges and Constraints**: The protocol must work within the constraints of the Chinese firewall, which typically uses a blacklist policy (allowing all sites by default and blocking specific sites) and tracks user web surfing behavior. It must also consider the increasing computing power available to Mallory for monitoring and auditing user traffic.
- **Proposed Solutions and Their Flaws**: Various ideas for transmitting data between Alice and Bob are discussed, including using long URLs, splitting data across form fields, HTTPS, JavaScript, and image or text steganography. However, each of these approaches has flaws and can be easily detected and blocked by Mallory.
- **The Proposed Solution**: The proposed solution involves Alice installing a miniature proxy server on her machine, which converts her URL requests into innocuous-looking text queries sent to Bob. Bob's responses are disguised as search engine results, with data hidden in page titles and meta descriptions. This approach aims to avoid detection by both automated systems and human monitors.
- **Security and User Behavior**: The protocol emphasizes security, aiming to avoid detection even with repeated use. It also highlights the importance of user behavior, as patterns (e.g., always accessing Bob's site after being blocked) can raise suspicions. Alice's client-end tool includes warnings to help prevent such patterns.
- **Conclusion and Future Work**: The speaker emphasizes the need for secure steganographic protocols, especially in countries with strict internet censorship. The discussion concludes with a mention of Peacefire.org, a website providing information on internet censorship and circumvention methods.
