In this presentation, the speakers share their knowledge and experience in malware development, focusing on Windows platforms and using C++ for direct access to Windows API. They discuss techniques to bypass modern defenses like antiviruses, sandboxes, and virtualized environments, as well as methods for obfuscating code and hindering debugging. They also provide insights into hiding malicious code in legitimate applications through code injection and backdooring. The speakers demonstrate how to identify and combat different types of detections, including signature-based, heuristic, and sandboxing. They also explain the use of shellcode and its anti-analysis mechanisms. Additionally, they cover topics such as anti-VM solutions, anti-debugging features, function hooking, and unhooking. The presentation includes practical examples and code snippets to illustrate the concepts.
