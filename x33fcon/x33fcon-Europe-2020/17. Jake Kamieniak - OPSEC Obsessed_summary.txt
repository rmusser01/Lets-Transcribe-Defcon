**OPSEC Obsessed**: Jake Kamieniak, a red teamer at General Electric, discusses the importance of OPSEC (Operational Security) and how it can empower or hinder red team strategies. 

**Definition of OPSEC**: Kamieniak defines OPSEC as a process that identifies critical information, develops measures to protect it, and determines when it ceases to be critical. Red teams adapt this to their plans, treating the blue team/company as the adversary. 

**Impact on Blue Team**: Kamieniak acknowledges that red team secrecy can cause skepticism and hurt feelings among blue team members, interrupting normal group behavior. He suggests evaluating OPSEC decisions by ensuring they are justified and transparent, preserving trust, and ultimately serving the organization's security goals. 

**Examples of OPSEC Decisions**: The speaker presents three areas where OPSEC decisions are crucial: vulnerabilities, TTPs (techniques, technologies, procedures), and methods/locations of access. He emphasizes considering the impact of disclosure on red team goals and blue team effectiveness. 

**Red Team Strategy**: Kamieniak stresses the importance of knowing and communicating the red team strategy, which should align with the organization's security objectives. He suggests a collaborative approach, where OPSEC decisions support the shared plan without revealing all details. 

**OPSEC as a Process**: Referencing the Army's model, Kamieniak highlights the need to actively consider critical information and the potential impact of disclosure on the red team's ability to deliver its strategy. He emphasizes that OPSEC decisions should focus on the organization's security rather than the red team's ability to hack. 

**Trust and Communication**: The speaker underscores the importance of trust and managing the emotional response to secrecy. He advises transparency and communication about OPSEC decisions and their alignment with the team strategy to maintain a positive reputation and effective collaboration. 

**Homework**: Kamieniak encourages attendees to discuss OPSEC with both red and blue teams, document OPSEC guidelines, and ensure they remain living documents.
