**Introduction**
- Speaker, Yael Daihes, presents "Mylobot, Detecting the Undetected with Deep Learning" at x33fcon.
- Daihes leads a security data science team at Akamai Technologies, a large CDN provider with extensive cyber security intelligence capabilities.
- The talk focuses on Mylobot, an emerging botnet that employs sophisticated evasion techniques, including DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm).

**Understanding Botnets and DGA**
- Botnets are networks of infected computers, or "bots," controlled by a central command.
- DGA is a technique used by malware to generate a large list of random-looking domain names for communication with the command server, making detection difficult.
- The challenge for defenders is to identify and block these domains before they are used for malicious activities.

**Defense Strategies against DGA**
- Traditional defense approaches involve reverse engineering malware samples to extract DGA code and reimplement it to predict future domain names.
- However, this method has limitations, including the need for the seed or key to generate the domains, and the inability to detect new or unknown malware families.

**Deep Learning to the Rescue**
- Daihes and team propose using deep learning algorithms to model and detect DGA-based malware patterns.
- They train a neural network, specifically an LSTM architecture, on a dataset of DGA and benign domain names to identify DGA patterns.
- The model achieves high accuracy but struggles to classify specific malware families, which is crucial for effective mitigation.

**Analyzing the Challenge**
- Daihes visualizes the neural network's representation of DGA domains and discovers that some malware families have similar DGA patterns, making classification difficult.
- This insight leads to the development of a new algorithm that can attribute specific malware families by grouping domains with similar patterns.

**The Akamai Detection System**
- Akamai's system processes DNS queries, grouping domains queried by a user within a specific time window.
- Each domain is analyzed by the deep learning model, which predicts the likelihood of it being a DGA domain.
- Domains that pass the threshold are grouped and attributed to specific malware families based on matching patterns, even for unknown or unreported malware.

**Results and Mylobot Case Study**
- The system automatically detects and blocks approximately 2.5 million domains and 70 million DNS requests per day, with near-zero false positives.
- It also tracks several unknown or unreported possible zero-day DGA malware families.
- Mylobot, a recently discovered botnet, is one of the detections made by the system. It has multiple variants and a rapidly growing infrastructure.
- Mylobot generates an enormous amount of traffic, with 200 million DNS queries per day, and has successfully infected thousands of entities.

**Conclusion and Takeaways**
- Monitoring DNS traffic and employing advanced detection systems, such as Akamai's, are effective countermeasures against botnets like Mylobot.
- DGA detection and mitigation at scale are possible, as demonstrated by the real-world results presented.
- Network-based threat intelligence can provide valuable insights, even without direct access to infected endpoints.
