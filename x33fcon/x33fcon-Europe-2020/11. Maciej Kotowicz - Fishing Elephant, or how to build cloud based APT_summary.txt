The speaker, Maciej Kotowicz, an independent malware researcher, presents a case study of an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group called "Phishing Elephant," which utilizes cloud-based services for its attacks. The group's strategy involves using publicly available tools and infrastructure to create successful espionage campaigns. Phishing Elephant targets South Asia and employs spear phishing emails with lures such as CVs and internal documents. They abuse cloud storage services like Dropbox and Google Drive to host payloads and exfiltrate data, taking advantage of unlimited storage and backup features. The group also uses platform-as-a-service providers like Heroku for computing power and free hosting. Maciej highlights the benefits of this approach from an attacker's perspective, including ease of setup, cost-effectiveness, and the ability to evade detection and attribution. However, he also points out cons such as metadata leakage and the potential for researchers to track attacks through unique URL patterns and shared access tokens. Phishing Elephant is characterized by its heavy reliance on publicly available tools and cloud storage services, with no apparent in-house development. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the challenges in detecting and attributing cloud-reliant attacks and provides insights into the group's ongoing activities.
