**Trust, But Verify: Maintaining Democracy** 

- Speaker: Allie Mellen, a security strategist, discusses election security beyond voting machines, focusing on pre and post-election day disruptions. 

**The Voter Hierarchy of Needs:** 

- Mellen introduces a hierarchy of needs for voters, building on Maslow's hierarchy, to understand factors influencing voter participation. 
- This includes physiological, safety, belonging, esteem, and self-actualization needs, which impact a person's willingness and ability to vote. 

**Expanding Election Infrastructure Definition:** 

- Mellen argues that the current definition of election infrastructure is too narrow, focusing only on IT systems like voter rolls and voting equipment. 
- She suggests including communication channels, social media, transit systems, and the electric grid, as disruptions to these can impact voter turnout and confidence. 

**Attacker Perspective:** 

- Mellen encourages adopting an attacker perspective to enhance election defense strategies. 
- She identifies nation-state goals as gaining power, spreading ideology, and maintaining global recognition, achieved by targeting infrastructure, information, and ethos layers. 

**Historical and Present-Day Examples:** 

- Mellen provides historical examples of election interferences, such as the 1948 Italian elections, where propaganda campaigns shaped public perception. 
- She also discusses present-day social media influence, disinformation campaigns, and communication attacks during the 2016 US election. 

**Disrupting Elections:** 

- Mellen explores potential cyberattacks on infrastructure, like electric grids and transit systems, which can cause confusion, division, and voter suppression. 

**Defender Perspective:** 

- Mellen emphasizes the need for a comprehensive definition of election security, addressing systems beyond government control. 
- She encourages system security, government collaboration, and misinformation mitigation to protect democratic institutions. 

**Conclusion:** 

- Mellen concludes by asking, "What can we do to protect democracy?" urging the audience to secure systems, work with governments, and fight misinformation.
