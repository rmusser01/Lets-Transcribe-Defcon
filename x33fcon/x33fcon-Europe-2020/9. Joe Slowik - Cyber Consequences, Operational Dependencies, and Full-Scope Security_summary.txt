The talk discusses the evolving nature of cyber-attacks and how they can have significant physical and reputational impacts, especially when paired with secondary effects or targeted at specific operational dependencies. The speaker, Joseph SÅ‚owik, highlights the need for a full-scope security approach that goes beyond traditional network defense. He emphasizes understanding an organization's value generation and the critical nodes in its processes, which attackers can exploit to cause disruption. Examples from Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, and the US illustrate how attackers target dependencies and process recovery to maximize impact. The speaker also discusses the role of offensive security and purple teaming in identifying and mitigating these risks. Finally, he expects incidents to worsen and urges defenders to adopt a value-defense mindset, expanding their scope beyond IT networks to include operational and external dependencies.
