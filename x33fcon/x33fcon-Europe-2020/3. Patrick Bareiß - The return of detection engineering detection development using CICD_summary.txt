**Introduction to Detection Engineering with CI/CD**

- Presenter: Patrick Barei√ü, Senior Threat Research Team, Splunk
- Emphasizes the importance of early bug detection in security detections to reduce costs.
- Proposes a modern approach using Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).
- Aims to improve detection rules, reduce false positives, and enhance the detection development process.

**CI/CD Overview**

- CI/CD is adapted from software development to address similar challenges in detection development.
- Four pillars: version control, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.
- Automation is key to getting new detections into production quickly and adapting to a changing threat landscape.

**Challenges in Detection Development**

- Rapidly evolving threat landscape requires continuous improvement and deployment of detections.
- Dynamic infrastructure can introduce false positives and the need for detection adjustments.
- Detection development process needs to be efficient to keep up with adversaries.
- Manual deployment, testing, and tuning of detections are time-consuming and error-prone.
- Emphasizes the importance of version control and collaboration in detection development.

**Version Control**

- Utilizes platforms like GitHub and GitLab for concurrent development and automation.
- Enables collaboration, change tracking, and disaster recovery.
- Allows for peer review and pull requests to ensure detection quality.

**Continuous Integration**

- Focuses on packaging, validation, peer review, and unit/integration testing of detections.
- Utilizes tools like CircleCI for automation and Attack Range for lab infrastructure and attack simulation.
- Attack Range supports multiple systems, logging configurations, and attack simulation engines.

**MITRE ATT&CK Matrix**

- A collection of tactics, techniques, and procedures used by attackers to achieve their goals.
- Provides a blueprint for detection development, focusing on commonly used ATT&CK vectors.

**Continuous Delivery and Deployment**

- Continuous delivery involves user acceptance testing of detections using tools like Caldera.
- Continuous deployment involves getting detections into the SIEM, either via packaging or REST API.
- Splunk Security Content is an open-source project with over 200 detections mapped to MITRE ATT&CK and data normalization.
- Automation tools like Circus CI streamline the detection development and deployment process.

**Conclusion**

- Emphasizes the importance of collaboration and sharing detections among Blue Teamers and defenders.
- CI/CD approach enhances detection quality, efficiency, and adaptability to keep up with adversaries.
