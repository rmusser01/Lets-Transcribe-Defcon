The presentation discusses malware hunting using network fingerprints, focusing on the behavior of malware rather than frequently changing blacklists. Fingerprinting tracks the unique behavior of malware families, providing a more effective detection method. Tools like JA3, HASSH, and FATT are used to fingerprint popular protocols and identify malware like Tofsee, Emotet, Trickbot, and Dridex. The speaker also proposes their own approach for HTTP fingerprinting, highlighting the limitations of current tools. They demonstrate how to use fingerprints to hunt malware and identify families involved in DDoS attacks and spam. The benefits of fingerprinting include constant elements that identify threats and distinguish between malware families, easy sharing of intelligence, and good generalization. Current challenges include collisions between malware families and benign software, and limited URL and payload analysis. The speaker introduces hfinger, a tool that analyzes URL and payload features to improve fingerprinting. hfinger is a working prototype with plans for further development.
