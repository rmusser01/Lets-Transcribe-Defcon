**Noa Weiss on the Unspoken Problems with Machine Learning in Security**

- Noa Weiss, an AI and ML consultant, discusses the challenges of ML in cybersecurity.
- ML is widely adopted but lags in security due to unique constraints and requirements.
- Anomaly detection algorithms, commonly used, have high false positive rates and are prone to human bias.
- The dynamic environment, adapting adversaries, and data confidentiality hinder ML model training and performance.
- Tagging data for ML in security is challenging due to expertise, context, and scale requirements.
- Imbalanced classes, where malicious data is rare, further complicates model training and prediction accuracy.
- Deep learning techniques lack explainability, crucial in security for blocking or reviewing user activities.
- The absence of public datasets and models limits collaboration and benchmarking in security ML.
- Solutions include creating public datasets, direct collaboration, and encouraging active discussions to advance security ML.
