Dominic Chell, a red team leader at MDSEC, presents strategies for enhancing post-exploitation tradecraft in mature environments with robust defenses such as EDR, ETW, and AMSI. He emphasizes the need to adapt and evade blue team detection methods while protecting red team tools and infrastructure. Chell introduces the concept of "offensive development," suggesting that red teams should operate entirely in code rather than relying on OS commands. He proposes a custom CI/CD pipeline, "Covert Toolsmith," to automate the process of building, obfuscating, and protecting tools, integrating them with C2 frameworks like Cobalt Strike. By dynamically generating and modifying tools on each run, red teams can increase their operational success and avoid leaving indicators of compromise. Chell also discusses techniques for keying tools to specific endpoints, making them harder to analyze and ensuring they only execute in the intended environment.
