In this talk, Amit Dori presents a new method for sandbox evasion using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) referencing. Sandboxes, widely used by organizations as the last line of defense, can be bypassed by attackers who exploit basic rules of how VBA macros and sandboxes operate. The presentation covers evasion and detection techniques, highlighting the need for collaboration between blue and red teams. Dori demonstrates how attackers can insert malicious code into servers without detection by taking advantage of VBA referencing, which allows for remote code execution. He also discusses the limitations of current sandbox evasion techniques and how sandboxes can identify and block them. The key difference between user and sandbox environments is highlighted, which forms the basis for the proposed attack. By crafting a document that loads an image and VBA code from a remote server, the order of requests can be used to identify and evade sandboxes. The proposed attack is successful against various sandbox solutions, and Dori suggests mitigations such as blocking SMB and restricting internet access for Office applications.
