In this presentation, Kamil Stawiarski demonstrates the potential security risks associated with consolidated database environments, specifically those running on Oracle. He begins by explaining the concept of consolidation and how a single vulnerable database can compromise the entire platform. Stawiarski then proceeds to a live demo, showcasing how an attacker with limited privileges can exploit a harmless-seeming privilege, "create an index," to gain unauthorized access. 

The speaker manipulates a function and creates a function-based index to execute code with the rights of a highly privileged user, "system." This enables a variety of malicious actions, including accessing tables in other schemas and inserting data. Stawiarski emphasizes the dangers of default settings, noting that SSH access is often left unsecured. He demonstrates an alternative technique using external tables with a preprocessor to execute commands as the "oracle" user, bypassing the need for SSH login. 

Stawiarski further highlights the risks associated with default installations, where paths and configurations are predictable, making it easier for attackers to craft exploits. He also mentions the lack of auditing access to the dictionary, which can be exploited to access data without any privileges. The speaker introduces a Python script that can access and modify data at the operating system level, bypassing encryption and database permissions. 

The presentation concludes with a discussion of additional security measures, such as Database Vault and data encryption, while also pointing out their limitations if the underlying configuration is not secure. Stawiarski emphasizes the importance of thinking beyond simply purchasing enterprise security products and the need to address default configurations, which can leave systems vulnerable.
