**IPv6 Network Reconnaissance:**

- Larger address space in IPv6 makes traditional brute-force address scans infeasible, requiring smarter scanning techniques.
- IPv6 addresses often follow specific patterns, allowing tools like Scan6 to infer and target specific address ranges.
- Leveraging search engines and certificate transparency logs can aid in discovering IPv6-enabled domain names.
- Recent changes in IPv6 address generation standards have increased the use of randomised addresses, enhancing security and privacy.
- DNS reverse mappings can be used to discover new IPv6 addresses, but results may include wildcard responses.
- Tools like Messi combine multiple techniques for IPv6 network reconnaissance, providing a comprehensive view.

**Speaker's Experience and Insights:**

- The speaker's work involves security research, protocol standards writing, and communications protocol security consulting.
- Search engines like Bing can be leveraged to discover domain names, especially for specific top-level domains.
- Certificate transparency logs provide a centralized record of issued certificates, useful for discovering IPv6-enabled domain names.
- Measurements reveal an increase in randomised IPv6 addresses, enhancing security, but some addresses still include MAC addresses.
- DNS reverse mapping techniques can discover new IPv6 addresses but may encounter filtering for prefixes longer than /48.
- Combining multiple techniques in tools like Messi provides more comprehensive IPv6 network reconnaissance results.
