The talk introduces "The Hunting ELK" (HELK), an open-source project combining ELK stack, Apache Spark, and GraphFrames for threat hunting and security analytics. The speaker explains the challenges of data collection and the need for graph analytics to identify patterns and relationships in large, unstructured datasets. They provide an overview of graph theory, types of graphs, and graph analytics algorithms. The HELK architecture is described, utilizing Kafka, Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and JupyterLab. Apache Spark's GraphFrames package enables graph creation and queries. Future plans include integrating Cypher for Apache Spark and improving real-time analytics with Kafka and Spark Streaming. The speaker demonstrates basic graph creation and queries using Jupyter Notebook and showcases the potential for advanced analytics and visualization.
