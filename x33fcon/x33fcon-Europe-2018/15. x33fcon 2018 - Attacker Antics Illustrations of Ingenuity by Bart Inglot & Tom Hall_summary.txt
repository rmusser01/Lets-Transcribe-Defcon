In the talk, "Attacker Antics: Illustrations of Ingenuity," Bart Inglot and Tom Hall presented nine techniques used by attackers that they found to be particularly interesting. They begin by discussing how attackers can utilize AV servers to distribute malware and then move on to breaking secure USB devices to breach air-gapped networks. They also cover APT32's use of DNS for C2, a web shell that requires an OTP, and an uncommon persistence mechanism. Additionally, they explore how attackers steal emails through transport agents and the use of special characters for disguise. They also emphasize the difficulty of creating effective signatures when attackers employ sophisticated techniques to hide. Finally, they highlight the agility of attackers like FIN7, who quickly adapt to new methods for targeting victims.
