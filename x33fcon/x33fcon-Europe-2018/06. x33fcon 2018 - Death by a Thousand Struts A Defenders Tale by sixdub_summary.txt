The presentation discusses the importance of collaboration between red and blue teams in cybersecurity. It highlights the need for blue teams to understand their detection capabilities and for detection authors to consider root causes and adversary behavior. Red teams, on the other hand, should focus their actions on threat emulation and furthering training objectives. The speaker shares their experience in incident response, specifically targeting Apache Struts vulnerabilities. They demonstrate how easily available signatures can be bypassed and provide guidance on developing more robust detection criteria. The talk also covers behavioral detection, outlier detection, and the importance of retaining forensic event-level details. Finally, the speaker reflects on their self-survey for red teamers and emphasizes the value of practicing in live environments.
