**Two-Factor Authentication Tokens and the Next Generation of Phishing:**

- Introduction: Kuba Gretzky, an independent software developer, presents a new approach to phishing for two-factor authentication tokens.
- Traditional phishing: Creating templates of web services to capture credentials, ineffective with two-factor authentication.
- Next-gen phishing: Setting up a relay proxy server between the victim and web service, dynamically retrieving and displaying content.
- Live demo: Gretzky demonstrates hacking his own account, receiving a push notification on his phone, and intercepting credentials and tokens.
- Bypassing two-factor auth: Importing captured cookies into the attacker's browser to gain access, regardless of the two-factor authentication method.
- Website protection: Obfuscation and regular expression modification can deter some attackers but may not be a full-proof solution.
