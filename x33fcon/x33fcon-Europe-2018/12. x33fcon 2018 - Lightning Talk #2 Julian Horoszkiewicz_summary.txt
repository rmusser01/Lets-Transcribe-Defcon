**OS Command Injection and Path Traversal:**

- False negatives can occur due to syntax, target OS, bad characters, input encoding, and feedback channels.
- Examples include vulnerable code with specific requirements, such as payloads ending with alphanumeric characters or doubly encoded input.
- OS-specific tricks to bypass restrictions, such as using environmental variables on Windows.
- Alternative feedback channels like time, network, or file creation may be needed when application output is limited or asynchronous.
- Comprehensive payload sets are designed to defeat poorly implemented filters and identify less obvious vulnerabilities.
- Projects and tools are available with in-depth methodologies to generate payloads for various assessments beyond web application testing.
