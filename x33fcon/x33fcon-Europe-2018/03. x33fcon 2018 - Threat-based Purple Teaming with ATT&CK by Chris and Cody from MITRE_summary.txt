The presentation discusses the benefits of purple teaming, a collaboration between red and blue teams in cybersecurity. They introduce the ATT&CK framework, which provides a common language for red and blue teams to communicate and plan tests, as well as measure and improve their performance over time. The speakers share their experience in using ATT&CK for adversary emulation, focusing on specific adversaries and their techniques. They emphasize the importance of threat intelligence and provide a step-by-step guide to creating an emulation plan, including gathering threat intelligence, determining the adversary's mode of operation, and mapping their techniques to ATT&CK. The presentation also covers the importance of removing Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from offensive frameworks and offers suggestions for improving detection capabilities. They conclude by announcing the release of adversary emulation plans for APT3 and APT29, including operator flows and cheat sheets.
