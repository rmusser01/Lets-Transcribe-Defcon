In his talk, Joe Slowik emphasizes the importance of focusing on the "how" rather than the "who" when it comes to threat intelligence and attribution. He argues that identifying specific behaviors and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of attackers is more valuable for network defenders than simply attributing attacks to a particular country or entity. By analyzing the behaviors and TTPs, defenders can develop playbooks, response procedures, and improve their overall defensive posture. Slowik introduces the concept of "activity groups," which are defined by their behaviors and TTPs rather than a specific actor or entity. He provides examples from his work at Dragos, where they tracked multiple activity groups with different TTPs and targets, all of which were attributed to a single broad-based campaign. Slowik also emphasizes the need to prioritize defensive resources based on an organization's threat model and the likelihood of specific attacks. He concludes by outlining a process for defenders to identify and characterize activity groups based on observable evidence and align their defenses accordingly.
