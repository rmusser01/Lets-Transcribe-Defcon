The speaker discusses the use of symbolic execution for vulnerability research and bug hunting. Symbolic execution is a technique for solving formulas and exploring all branches of a program. It can be used to find vulnerabilities and has been proven effective by tools like angr in the Cyber Grand Challenge. The speaker provides demos of using symbolic execution frameworks like Klee and angr to find bugs in various programs, including a simple C program, a maze game, and CTF challenges. They also discuss the limitations and countermeasures of symbolic execution and how it can be applied to real-world software.
