The speaker, David Bianco, presents techniques for outlier detection in threat hunting, emphasizing the limitations of relying solely on stack counting or least frequency occurrence analysis. He suggests using scatterplots, box plots, and isolation forests as alternative methods for identifying anomalies in data. These methods are especially useful when dealing with numeric data and offer advantages in automated alerting and signature creation. Bianco also introduces ThreatHunting.net, a website indexing successful recipes for threat hunting across various data types. He concludes by encouraging the audience to experiment with different outlier detection techniques and contribute their findings to the community.
