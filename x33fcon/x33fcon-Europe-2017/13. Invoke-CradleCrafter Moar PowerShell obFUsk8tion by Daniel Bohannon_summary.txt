Daniel Bohannon, an incident response consultant with Mandiant, presents new tools and techniques for PowerShell obfuscation and evasion at x33fcon 2017. Bohannon begins by discussing the motivation behind his research, highlighting the increasing use of PowerShell by attackers and the need for improved detection methods. He introduces "Invoke-CradleCrafter," a tool for crafting cryptic PowerShell cradles, and demonstrates its capabilities through live obfuscation examples. Bohannon also covers various invocation syntaxes, including disk-based and memory-based options, and provides insights into detecting obfuscated PowerShell activity. He emphasizes the importance of upgrading to PowerShell 5 and leveraging its enhanced logging and security features. The presentation concludes with a call for collaboration between red and blue teams to enhance detection capabilities and stay ahead of evolving attack techniques.
