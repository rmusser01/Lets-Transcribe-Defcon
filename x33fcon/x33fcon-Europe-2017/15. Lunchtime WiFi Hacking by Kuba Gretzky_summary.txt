**Lunchtime WiFi Hacking by Kuba Gretzky:**

- **Introduction:** Kuba Gretzky, an independent contractor with experience in reverse engineering and security research, presents a Wi-Fi penetration testing device.
- **Device Overview:** Gretzky introduces a proof-of-concept device with three wireless adapters, allowing for network scanning, connection, and deauthentication.
- **Functionality:** The device can be controlled via a mobile phone, enabling users to scan nearby networks, add targets, connect to networks, and create access points.
- **Internet Tethering:** Gretzky demonstrates how to share an internet connection from a phone or wireless access point, enabling further attacks.
- **HTTP Proxy:** The core of the tool is an efficient HTTP proxy written in C++, enabling various attacks, including browser update page redirection and fake Google login pages.
- **Other Features:** The device includes a Wi-Fi cracker with WPS querying and plans to add a responder for SMB request interception. Users can also plug in a modem to share the internet connection.
- **Projects:** Gretzky mentions two projects, "Evil Jinx" and an update to his Wi-Fi cracker, both released prior to the presentation.
- **Conclusion:** Gretzky seeks feedback and suggestions for future implementations, emphasizing the device's potential for penetration testing.
