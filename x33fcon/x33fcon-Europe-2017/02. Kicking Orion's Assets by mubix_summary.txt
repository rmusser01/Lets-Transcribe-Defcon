A security researcher presents their findings on the vulnerabilities of SolarWinds Orion, a network monitoring platform. They detail their process of reverse-engineering the software to uncover insecure password storage practices, hard-coded credentials, and an exportable encryption certificate. The researcher also demonstrates how to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Additionally, they discuss the implications of similar vulnerabilities in RabbitMQ, a message broker software, and offer suggestions for mitigating the risks associated with these security flaws.
