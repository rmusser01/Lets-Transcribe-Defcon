The speaker presents techniques for exploiting USB connections for offensive security purposes, focusing on the USB Armory, a handheld device with a USB form factor. They provide an overview of HID (Human Interface Device) attacks, which involve plugging in a USB device that mimics a keyboard or mouse to execute malicious commands. The USB Armory's ability to emulate USB connections and run Linux makes it a powerful tool for such attacks. The speaker also discusses composite devices, which combine multiple functionalities (e.g., Ethernet and HID), and their potential for data exfiltration. They demonstrate simple HID attacks on Windows and a composite device attack on Linux. The speaker concludes by addressing some challenges and workarounds when performing these attacks, such as compatibility issues with different operating systems and USB subsystems.
