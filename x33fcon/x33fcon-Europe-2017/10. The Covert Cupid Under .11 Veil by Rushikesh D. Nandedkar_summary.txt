In this talk, Rushikesh D. Nandedkar explores the concept of exploiting IEEE 802.11 broadcast frames to smuggle data. He begins by explaining the motivation behind his research, which was to find a way to avoid being a victim of wireless network attacks rather than just mitigating them. He then discusses the basic structure of wireless networks and the different modes of operation for wireless devices. Nandedkar introduces the idea of code channels, which are used to transfer information between processes that are not usually allowed to communicate. He focuses on the data link layer and specifically on beacon and probe frames, which do not require authentication or association. By manipulating the information elements within these frames, Nandedkar was able to inject data and create a broadcast attack. He demonstrates this through a live demo and shares the scripts he used. Finally, he acknowledges the limitations of this approach, such as deep packet inspection firewalls, and mentions ongoing work to sequence data in non-standard connectivity mechanisms.
