In this talk, Roberto Rodriguez, a security researcher for the Microsoft Security Research Organization, explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in cybersecurity. He begins by explaining the fundamentals of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning, and their role in the development of LLMs. He introduces the concept of Generative AI and how it can enable new capabilities for security researchers. Through a series of demonstrations, Rodriguez showcases how LLMs can be applied to various security tasks such as sentiment analysis, text summarization, and code generation. He also discusses the importance of few-shot learning and prompting in adapting LLMs to specific tasks. The talk includes practical examples of using LLMs to query threat actor knowledge, generate Cypher queries, and interact with databases. Rodriguez emphasizes the potential benefits of LLMs in enhancing the work of security analysts and researchers.
