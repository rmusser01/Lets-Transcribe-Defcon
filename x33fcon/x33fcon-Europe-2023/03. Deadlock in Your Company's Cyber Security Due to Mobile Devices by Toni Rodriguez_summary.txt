In this talk, Tony Rodriguez presents his research on mobile device security, specifically targeting Android systems. He begins by highlighting the prevalence of Android devices and the fragmented nature of the ecosystem, making it vulnerable to attacks. Rodriguez then discusses various methods of malware distribution, including writing custom applications, modifying existing code, and purchasing apps to inject malicious code. He also mentions the use of phishing, proxy apps, and PWAs (Progressive Web Applications) for malware spread. 

Rodriguez provides a technical deep dive into Android application components, particularly Activities, Intents, and Broadcasts, explaining how they can be exploited to send data between applications without user knowledge. He demonstrates a proof-of-concept malware that utilizes Google Chrome to communicate with a command-and-control server without requiring internet permissions. Additionally, he explores other communication protocols such as MQTT, peer-to-peer networks, and super cookies for controlling infected devices. 

The speaker then shifts focus to data sources, emphasizing the importance of OSINT (Open-source Intelligence) for identifying infected users. He presents a proxy chain architecture to obscure the origin of commands sent to infected devices and demonstrates the use of closet APIs and data leaks (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn) for user profiling. Rodriguez also discusses weaponizing metadata, including EXIF data, and demonstrates steganography techniques for hiding messages within images. He concludes by exploring image recognition and facial recognition technologies, emphasizing the potential privacy risks associated with biometric data.
