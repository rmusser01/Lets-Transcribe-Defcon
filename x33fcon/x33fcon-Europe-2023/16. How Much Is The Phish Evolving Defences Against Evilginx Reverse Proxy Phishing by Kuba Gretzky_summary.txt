In the talk, Kuba Gretzky, the creator of Evil Jinx, a reverse proxy phishing framework, discusses the prevalence of reverse proxy phishing attacks and the lack of effective countermeasures. Gretzky emphasizes the importance of raising the cost for attackers to perform such operations. He suggests that website developers should take more responsibility for protecting their users, rather than relying on users to secure themselves. Gretzky demonstrates how Evil Jinx works and how it can bypass multi-factor authentication by capturing session tokens. He also introduces the concept of secret tokens, a client-side protection technique used by websites like LinkedIn and Google, which adds an extra layer of encryption to post requests during login. Gretzky concludes by suggesting defensive strategies, including domain validation and JavaScript obfuscation, to make phishing more difficult and costly for attackers.
