The presentation provides an overview of the Winnti group, a China-linked espionage group that has captured headlines for allegedly breaching organizations worldwide. The speaker traces the group's origins and highlights the discrepancies in how different threat intelligence teams have defined and tracked the group. It is suggested that Winnti is not a group but rather a malware tool used by various actors for different purposes. The presentation concludes with a recommendation for creating analytical models to define and track such groups based on one's specific needs and requirements.
