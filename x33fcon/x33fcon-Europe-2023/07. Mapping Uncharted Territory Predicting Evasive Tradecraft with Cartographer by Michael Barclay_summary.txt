Michael Barclay introduces Cartographer, a web application that predicts possible procedures for a given technique, aiding in the development of detection rules and offensive tooling. He emphasizes the cyclical nature of innovation between attackers and defenders, where predictions and assumptions play a crucial role. Barclay defines a procedure as an ordered set of operations targeting specific objects and provides a data model with tactics, techniques, and procedures as categorical labels. He highlights the importance of understanding functional paths and their impact on telemetry, secureable objects, and evasion. The Cartographer web app aims to cover depth over breadth, offering detailed insights into procedures, operations, and their variations. The future includes open-sourcing, integrations, and improved documentation.
