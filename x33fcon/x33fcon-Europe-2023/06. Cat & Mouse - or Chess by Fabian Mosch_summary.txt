Here is a summary of the transcript:

Fabian Mosch presents a talk on bypassing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, specifically focusing on userland hooking techniques. He begins by explaining the role of EDRs in detecting and preventing cyber attacks, and how they employ userland hooking to monitor Windows API calls. Mosch then provides an overview of existing techniques to bypass these detections, including unhooking, using direct syscalls, hardware breakpoints, and DLL entry point patching. He also mentions the challenges of writing position-independent code and debugging such implementations.

The main focus of the talk is Mosch's new approach to bypassing userland hooking, inspired by a blog post on bypassing AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface). He explains the idea of blocking EDR DLLs from loading into a new process by intercepting the DLL loading process and preventing specific DLLs from being loaded. Mosch highlights the requirement for the target DLL to not be already loaded and the challenge of EDRs making the first move by loading their DLL directly from the kernel.

To address this, Mosch proposes creating a new suspended process, allocating memory, and injecting custom shellcode to remotely hook and control the DLL loading process. He discusses the challenges faced during implementation, such as writing position-independent code, resolving APIs at runtime, and restoring the original NT create section value. He also mentions potential OPSEC improvements, such as using userland hook evasion and hardware breakpoints instead of injection.

The proof-of-concept, named "Rui Lopez," successfully blocks AMSI DLL from loading into a PowerShell process, evading detection by Defender. Mosch tested it against multiple EDR vendors and found no alerts or prevention of DLL blocking. He also notes limitations, such as crashes when blocking certain DLLs, and emphasizes the need for OPSEC improvements to avoid detection. The proof-of-concept will be published after the talk, along with potential alternative usage ideas. Mosch acknowledges the contributions of several individuals and tools that aided in the development of the proof-of-concept.
