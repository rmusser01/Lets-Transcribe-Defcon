**Threat Hunting in ICS/SCADA Networks:**
- Exploring new ideas for threat hunting in ICS/SCADA networks, focusing on secure visualization and instrumentation.
- Utilizing physics-based data collection to identify advanced adversarial threats, going beyond traditional network monitoring methods.
- Emphasizing the importance of monitoring the Internet of Military Things (IoMT) and ICS/SCADA infrastructure to detect complex threats.

**Speaker Introduction:**
- Paul Coggin from Huntsville, Alabama, speaking at X33FCon for the fourth time.
- Appreciation for Poland's beauty, people, and cuisine.

**Talk Overview:**
- Inspiration from the movie "Transformers" and the Stuxnet attack on Iranian centrifuges.
- Need to go beyond traditional network monitoring and log correlation.
- Applying the Purdue model to critical infrastructure and large enterprises, focusing on lower-level physical systems.
- Collecting physics-based data such as electrical signals, vibration, and current draw to enhance cybersecurity.
- Highlighting the lack of security in Level 0 and Level 1 devices in industrial control systems and SCADA.
- Confirming the importance of physics-based data sources through MITRE ATT&CK's 39 data sources.

**Physics-Based Data Sources:**
- Vibration sensors for critical infrastructure like gas pipelines.
- Acoustic monitoring of pipes and power transformers to detect anomalies.
- Monitoring harmonics from current draw to detect software running on targeted systems.
- Timing synchronization in power grids and its vulnerability to GPS spoofing and NTP attacks.
- Satellite control systems and navigation systems on ships as potential targets for cyberattacks.

**Examples of Cyber Attacks:**
- German ship steered by pirates for 10 hours.
- Iranian research on using cyber attacks to cause physical damage.
- Ship headed to New York with navigational system compromise.
- Frequent GPS spoofing attempts, especially during the Ukraine war, to disrupt drone operations.

**Other Physics-Based Sensors:**
- Echo sounder on ships to measure water depth.
- Anemometer for wind monitoring, relevant to the Suez Canal incident.
- Accelerometer and gyroscope for mechanical-to-electrical signal conversion.
- Voyage data recorder as a "black box" for ships, providing independent instrumentation data.

**Telecommunications Networks:**
- Vulnerabilities in telecommunications service provider networks, including BGP hijacking and MPLS VPN intrusions.
- Using timing as a detection method for traffic redirection or injection.

**Military and Emergency Responder Technology:**
- Proliferation of specialized sensors and devices on troops and emergency responders.
- Need for threat hunting, forensics, and incident response on these devices.
- Leveraging software-defined radio to monitor various communication protocols (LORA, LORAWAN, SATCOM, Ham radio).

**Emerging Technologies:**
- Internet of Space Things with SpaceX's Swarm satellites in low Earth orbit.
- Challenges in forensics, incident response, and threat hunting for low Earth orbit devices.

**Satellite Cybersecurity:**
- Examples of hacked satellites: Landsat 7, Terra, NOAA, ROSAT, and UK Skynet.
- 23 different space operating systems identified, with a focus on Linux-based kernels.
- Command languages and protocols used in satellite communications (CCSDS, ECSS, IP, IPv6).

**Self-Defending Satellites:**
- Aerospace Corporation's Slingshot satellite with intrusion prevention system.
- Satellite with software-defined radio to defend against frequency jamming.

**Cybersecurity Tools:**
- MITRE ATT&CK, ATLAS (for adversarial machine learning), SHIELD (by European Space Agency), SPARTA, TREX (by Dr. Jacob Oakley), and Caldera.
