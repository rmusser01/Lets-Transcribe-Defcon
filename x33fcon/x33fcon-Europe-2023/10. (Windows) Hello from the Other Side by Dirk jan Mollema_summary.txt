- Dirk Jan Mollema, a security researcher from the Netherlands, presented his findings on Windows Hello for Business (WHFB), a passwordless authentication offering from Microsoft. 
- WHFB uses cryptographic keys stored on a trusted device, unlocked via a PIN, face recognition, or fingerprint. It can be deployed in Azure AD, on-prem Active Directory, or a hybrid setup. 
- Prior research on WHFB focused on on-prem AD, and Mollema aimed to explore its implementation in Azure AD. 
- He discovered that WHFB keys could be overwritten on devices, bypassing MFA and TPM protection. This could provide attackers with persistent access to user identities. 
- Additionally, users could modify their own searchable device keys attributes, allowing MFA bypass and lateral movement between users. 
- In hybrid setups with Cloud Kerberos Trusts, a virtual read-only domain controller is created in AD, allowing WHFB users to obtain Kerberos tickets and their NT hash. 
- Global admins in Azure AD could potentially gain domain admin privileges by provisioning keys and recovering NT hashes for synced users. 
- Microsoft has since fixed some of the vulnerabilities disclosed by Mollema, improving the security of WHFB authentication. 
- Mollema emphasizes the importance of device control and highlights that while WHFB is more secure than passwords, it may not provide the strongest form of multi-factor authentication.
