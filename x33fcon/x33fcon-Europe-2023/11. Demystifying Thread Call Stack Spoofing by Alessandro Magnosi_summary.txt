The talk, "Demystifying Thread Call Stack Spoofing," presented by Alessandro Magnosi, focuses on stack spoofingâ€”an evasion technique used to manipulate and conceal the caller module in a thread's call stack. After introducing stack spoofing and relevant Windows internals, Magnosi discusses existing stack spoofing approaches, such as stack truncation, stack crafting, stack cloning, and stack hiding. He then introduces a new technique called "stack moonwalking," which combines stack frames forging with ROP and JOP to achieve maximum stealth. Stack moonwalking uses a set of frames (setfpreg, pushreg, synchronization, and concealed) to trick the unwinding algorithm and create a legitimate-looking call stack. On return, a job gadget and a restore function ensure smooth execution back to the main module. Magnosi also addresses defensive considerations, emphasizing the effectiveness of Hardware-enforced Stack Protection (CHSP) and suggesting stack inspection methods to detect stack moonwalking. He concludes by highlighting the flexibility of the stack moonwalking technique and the potential for creating completely valid call stacks.
