**Initial Access and Infection Chains:**
- The landscape of initial access is rapidly evolving, with vendors introducing new mitigations and countermeasures.
- Complex/desperate infection chains refer to multiple steps chained together to guide victims towards ultimate breach/payload execution.
- These chains involve delivery, containers, triggers, payloads, and decoys to deceive and exploit users.

**Code Signing Threats:**
- Code signing certificates can be stolen, leaked, or cracked, and used to sign various file types, impacting their legitimacy.
- Red teams should incorporate code-signed payloads, while blue teams should stay updated on leaked certificates and implement hunting queries.

**Delivery and Containers:**
- HTML/SVG smuggling is a common delivery method, bypassing proxy policies by embedding files within HTML/SVG code.
- Containers bundle multiple files required for infection, including ISOs, ZIPs, Windows Images, and PowerShell's Expand Archive.

**Triggers and Payloads:**
- LNK and CHM files are commonly used triggers to execute commands upon double-clicking.
- Payloads include Microsoft-signed executables, DLLs, CPLs, XLLs, XLAMs, MSIs, ClickOnce applications, and custom interpreters/scripts.

**Decoys and Recommendations:**
- Decoys maintain user deception by displaying benign documents post-payload execution.
- Red teams should experiment with complex chains, while blue teams focus on CHMs, MSIs, MSIXs, ClickOnce, and evasive triggers/payloads.
- LNKs, CPLs, XLLs, and Office Macros are discouraged due to improved detection and countermeasures.
