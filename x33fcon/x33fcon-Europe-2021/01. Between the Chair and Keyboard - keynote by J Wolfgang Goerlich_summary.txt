J Wolfgang Goerlich, an advisory CISO with Cisco Secure, presents a model for improving cybersecurity by focusing on the user experience. Goerlich argues that the majority of data breaches involve human error and that blaming users for security issues is counterproductive. Instead, he suggests analyzing user behaviour and designing security measures that work with users rather than against them. Goerlich's model involves considering the path and choices users make, reducing steps and complexity, and providing clear communications. He also emphasizes the importance of security champions and advocates within organizations to facilitate feedback and improve security programmes. Additionally, Goerlich discusses the impact of constraints on user creativity and risk-taking, as well as the potential for security measures to speed up user workflows. Finally, he draws a parallel between physical ergonomics and the need for a human-centric approach to cybersecurity.
