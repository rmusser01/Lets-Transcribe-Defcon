This presentation by Jackson T. explores the OODA loop model and its application in red team operations and EDR sensor evasion. The OODA loop, or Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop, is a decision-making framework developed by John Boyd, a US Air Force fighter pilot and strategist. Jackson explains how operators make decisions and how this understanding can be used to circumvent EDR sensors. The talk covers the operator's OODA loop, including information gathering, analysis, option consideration, and action execution. It also delves into EDR sensors' OODA loop, focusing on confidentiality, integrity, and availability attacks. Jackson provides recommendations for evading EDR sensors by understanding their telemetry, signatures, configurations, and telemetry flow. The presentation concludes by discussing the potential for data-driven EDR bypasses and optimization techniques in operations.
