**COVID-19 Tracing Apps: The Proliferation of Rush Development** 

- **Overview:** Presentation by Aleksander Frelas and John Butler on security and privacy concerns in COVID-19 contact tracing apps, highlighting the need for trust and improved development practices. 
- **Testing Approach:** Analyzed 95 apps (60% using Exposure Notifications API and 40% DIY approaches) across Android and iOS platforms, evaluating protection mechanisms and controls. 
- **Data Analysis:** DIY Android and iOS apps lacked static and dynamic security protections, with sensitive data often unencrypted, exposing users to potential risks. 
- **Privacy Concerns:** Apps collected unnecessary personal information, violating GDPR and HIPAA regulations, and lacked transparency in data handling. 
- **Development Challenges:** Rushed development timelines, integration difficulties, ethical dilemmas, and limited security considerations impacted app security. 
- **Recommendations:** Unify apps with common APIs, implement security-focused SDLC, adhere to security standards, employ masked scanning and code hardening solutions, and balance time, cost, and quality constraints. 
- **Code Hardening:** Emphasizes the need for specialized security knowledge and solutions to protect user data and earn user trust. 
- **Future Projects:** Vaccine passport apps as potential research area, suggesting test cases for validation and approval status manipulation.
