**Utilizing LoL Drivers in Post-Exploitation Tradecraft**

- **Baris Akkaya**, Red Team Engineer at PQ Security, discusses the use of LoL (Low) drivers in post-exploitation tradecraft, focusing on offensive security practices and kernel-mode attacks.
- Kernel-mode attacks are favored by threat actors to evade defensive measures and bypass user-mode controls.
- API hooking is a defensive mechanism used to detect user-mode attacks, but attackers can employ various techniques to deal with it.
- Deploying kernel-mode attacks is challenging due to the difficulty in creating stable rootkits, the need for administrative privileges, and Microsoft's restrictions like driver signature enforcement and patch guard.
- The presentation introduces the concept of LoL drivers and how they can be utilized for offensive purposes, specifically using the Process Hacker tool as an example.
- By analyzing the Process Hacker driver source code, Akkaya identifies IoCTL codes that can be exploited for malicious purposes.
- Through code demonstrations, it is shown how to alter the execution flow of a program by replacing standard API calls with IoCTL calls, making it harder for defensive products to detect.
- The advantages of using IoCTLs include creating a non-standard behavior, bypassing user-mode access checks, and potentially evading detection by modern altruist programs.
- Akkaya also demonstrates how to dynamically modify tools to use IoCTLs by using API hooking, allowing redirection of API calls to IoCTLs in the Process Hacker driver.
- The presentation includes a demonstration of injecting a shellcode into a process using the LoL driver, showcasing how this technique can be used for process injection.
- ProtectedProcessLite (PPL), a Windows feature, is discussed as a mitigation for credential dumping attacks, and the presenter explains how to interact with PPL processes using the LoL driver.
- Akkaya introduces a tool called "Offensive Process Hacker" that gathers the techniques presented, and encourages future research and contributions to the project.
