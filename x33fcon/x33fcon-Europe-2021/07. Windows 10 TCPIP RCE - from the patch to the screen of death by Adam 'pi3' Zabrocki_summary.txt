The presentation discusses a critical vulnerability, CVE-2020-16898, nicknamed "Bad Neighbor," in the TCP/IP stack of Windows 10. It is considered a "worst-case scenario" due to its pre-authentication nature, affecting kernel-level privileges, and being challenging to mitigate. The bug was initially disclosed and patched by Microsoft, with subsequent detection signatures created by security companies. The speaker's interest in analyzing this bug is highlighted, along with their experience in the cybersecurity field. They emphasize the rarity of such bugs in the TCP/IP stack and the potential catastrophic consequences if exploited. Through a detailed technical journey, the speaker describes how they reverse-engineered the detection logic, identified the specific vulnerability in the RDNSS option, and developed a working proof-of-concept exploit. They uncover several key insights, such as the need for a local link prefix address and the impact of even numbers in the length field. By brute-forcing different options and analyzing their impact, they identify the potential for recursively triggering the bug. The presentation concludes with a successful demonstration of crashing an updated Windows 10 system using the exploit, along with a detailed write-up and resources shared by the speaker.
