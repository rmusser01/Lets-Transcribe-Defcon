- Rob Fuller (Mubix) presents "Jurassic Malware," exploring the use of virtualization and emulation as persistence methods in malware development. 
- Malware creation has become more challenging due to automated cloud submissions, sandboxing, behavioral analysis, and EDRs. 
- Virtualization and emulation offer new avenues for malware, bypassing traditional defenses. Mubix demonstrates this with various platforms: AWS, ESXi, QEMU, Docker, WSL, etc. 
- By targeting the network rather than individual systems, attackers gain access to internal resources. 
- Mubix provides technical details and code snippets for each platform, showing how to exploit them for malware deployment. 
- Defenders need to adapt by empowering users to report suspicious behavior and focusing on detecting malicious VMs and activities within virtualization platforms.
