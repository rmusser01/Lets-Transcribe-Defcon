The presentation offers strategies for hunting beacons and C2 servers, focusing on detecting beaconing characteristics and understanding adversary tools. It defines beaconing and highlights the challenges of creating signatures or rules for detection due to payload obfuscation and encryption. Four hypotheses are presented for analysis, including connection intervals and HTTP header configurations. The speaker shares their experience in network defense and incident response, providing insights into detecting beaconing over HTTP and HTTPS, with a specific case study of North Korean APT Lazarus' fake DLS protocol. They also introduce proactive methods for hunting C2 servers and emphasize the importance of understanding default settings and burning adversary tools.
