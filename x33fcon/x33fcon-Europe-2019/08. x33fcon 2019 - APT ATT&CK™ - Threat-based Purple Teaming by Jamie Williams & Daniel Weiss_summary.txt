**x33fcon 2019 — APT ATT&CK™ — Threat-based Purple Teaming by Jamie Williams & Daniel Weiss**

- Building on the previous year's talk, the presenters from MITRE discuss threat-based purple teaming using ATT&CK, a knowledge base of adversary behaviour.
- ATT&CK provides a structured framework for understanding and defending against threats, with tactics, techniques, and procedures.
- The presenters demonstrate an iterative purple teaming process, starting with emulating a specific technique, defending against it, and then improving the emulation to bypass the defence.
- They emphasize the importance of transparency between red and blue teams and provide examples of using open-source frameworks for emulation.
- The detection process is explained, including data sources, sensors, and analysis, with a focus on detecting .NET-based malware.
- The presenters conclude by recommending a notional defensive approach, combining realtime detection with hunt/IR processes and protections.
- Resources and contact information for MITRE's ATT&CK and related projects are provided.
