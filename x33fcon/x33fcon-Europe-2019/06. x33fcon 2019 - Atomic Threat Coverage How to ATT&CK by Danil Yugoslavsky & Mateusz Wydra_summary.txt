Danil Yugoslavsky and Mateusz Wydra present their project, Atomic Threat Coverage, a framework for generating actionable analytics to combat cyber threats based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework. They discuss the challenges of collaboration between different functions/processes and the lack of a common threat model/classification. The Atomic Threat Coverage framework provides a unified methodology and threat model, enabling security teams to collaborate effectively. The framework includes detection rules, response playbooks, data collection, and visualization capabilities. The presentation also covers the use of plain text files, version control systems, and automation to streamline the process. The speakers demonstrate how to implement Atomic Threat Coverage and showcase the automatically generated dashboards and visualizations. They emphasize the benefits of working with text files, automation, and compatibility with community projects. The project aims to stimulate the use of Atomic Red Team and Sigma project formats and evangelize the adoption of the MitreTag framework.
