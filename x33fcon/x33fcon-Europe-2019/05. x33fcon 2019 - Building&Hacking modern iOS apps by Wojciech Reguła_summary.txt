In this talk, Wojciech Reguła, a senior IT security consultant, presents an overview of secure iOS/macOS app development and highlights common vulnerabilities. He begins by dispelling myths about the iOS platform, emphasizing that Apple's review process can be bypassed and that jailbreaking and reverse engineering are still possible. He then discusses secure development practices, including language choices, data storage, cryptography, and network communication. Reguła provides examples of real-world vulnerabilities, such as insecure token generation and certificate pinning issues, found in popular apps like Twitter and Yahoo Mail. He introduces his new library, iOS Security Suite, for detecting jailbreaks and protecting against reverse engineering tools. The presentation concludes with recommendations for developers to improve app security, such as using password managers, considering anti-tampering tools, and adopting WKWebView. Reguła emphasizes the importance of security-aware development and suggests pen testing for high-risk applications.
