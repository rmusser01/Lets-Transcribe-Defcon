At the x33fcon conference, two red team operators from Outflank presented their tools and strategies for monitoring blue team activities and maintaining control during red team operations. They introduced RedELK, an open-source tool that centralizes and enriches logs from redirectors and team servers, providing oversight and insight into the red team's infrastructure. RedELK enables searching, reporting, and alerting on indicators of compromise (IOCs) and blue team activities. They also discussed RedFile, a tool for dynamically serving payloads based on conditions such as IP address, user agent, or time. By tailoring payloads, red teams can control the engagement and provide a better training experience for blue teams. The presenters emphasized the importance of collaboration between red and blue teams and shared techniques for improving blue team OPSEC.
