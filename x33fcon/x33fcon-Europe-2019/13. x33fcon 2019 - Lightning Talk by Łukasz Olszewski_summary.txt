**Speaker Introduction:**
- ≈Åukasz Olszewski, leading Caesar Threat Intelligence and EDR at Atos

**Talk Overview:**
- Improving detection and response in cybersecurity using data science and orchestration
- Addressing issues like alert fatigue, human errors, and insider threats
- Leveraging data already collected for customers

**Goal:**
- Enhancing traditional SOC approach by improving detection and decision support/response
- Adding user behavior analytics (UBA) for anomaly detection
- Aggregating detections and insights for analysts

**Challenges and Solutions:**
- Alert fatigue: adding UBA as a new source of alerts
- Context gathering: querying multiple systems for insights (SIEM, threat intelligence DB, domain controller)
- Decision-making: providing a 360-view to analysts before human analysis
- Response: automating response actions (e.g., deleting malicious emails, locking user accounts)

**Summary:**
- Atos' journey from reactive to prescriptive security
- Leveraging existing data and investments to improve detection and response
- Relieving SOC analysts from manual tasks, enabling focus on threat hunting
- Emphasizing the importance of automation and data analytics in cybersecurity
