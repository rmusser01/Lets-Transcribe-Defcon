In their talk, Jason Kitchen and Alex Orleans discuss the misconceptions about state-nexus threat actors and their operations. They argue that while these actors are often perceived as sophisticated and well-planned, there is a human element of chaos involved. They focus on APT28 (Fancy Bear) and Sandworm activity, drawing insights from US government indictments. They explore how strategic culture, organizational culture, competition, leadership demands, and domestic politics impact operations. The speakers provide case studies illustrating the chaotic dynamics, such as the Russian interference in the 2016 US election and GRU hacking to undermine anti-doping efforts. They emphasize the importance of understanding adversary behavior holistically and suggest applying intelligence studies to cyber operations. The presentation offers insights for blue and red teams to enhance detection engineering, emulation activities, and threat hunting.
