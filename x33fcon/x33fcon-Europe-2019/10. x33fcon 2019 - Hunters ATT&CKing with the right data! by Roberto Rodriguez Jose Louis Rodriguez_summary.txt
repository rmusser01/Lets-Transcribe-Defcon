The presentation discusses the importance of understanding data for effective threat hunting and security investigations. It emphasizes the need to go beyond simply collecting data and focus on comprehending the specific data sources and their relevance to security events. The speaker shares their experience working with a large volume of data and the challenges faced by organizations in managing and utilizing their data effectively. The MITRE ATT&CK framework is introduced as a valuable resource for mapping data sources to security techniques. The speaker provides a methodology for documenting and structuring data, including data dictionaries and data models, to gain deeper insights into security events. They also introduce their open-source projects, such as ThreatHunter-Playbook and Open Source Security Event Metadata (OSSEM), which aim to enhance threat hunting programs. The presentation concludes with a demonstration of the Mordor project, which provides pre-generated security events associated with specific attack techniques, allowing analysts to study and detect potential threats without needing to execute the attacks themselves.
