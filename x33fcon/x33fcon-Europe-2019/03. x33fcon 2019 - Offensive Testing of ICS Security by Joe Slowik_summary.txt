The talk focuses on offensive testing of ICS security and the importance of adopting a "whole of kill chain" approach that covers all stages of an attack, from initial access to final impact. The speaker, Joe Slowik, highlights the trends in ICS attack tradecraft and the implications for defenders. He also emphasizes the need for a purple team approach, combining red and blue team strategies, to effectively test and secure ICS environments. Slowik provides an overview of ICS, its increasing adoption of IT practices, and the resulting expansion of the attack surface. He then discusses the ICS cyber kill chain, differentiating between the IT-centric initial stages and the ICS-specific disruption stage. The speaker also offers insights into the preparatory actions and attacks, emphasizing the need to focus on deny, degrade, and destroy actions. He presents a timeline of ICS attacks, noting the shift from custom malware to commodity tools and the increasing specialization in ICS disruption techniques. 

Slowik highlights the importance of gaining asset owner trust and having operationally significant knowledge when conducting security tests. He outlines the different stages of ICS security testing, including initial intrusion, IT-ICS pivot, and ICS impact, and emphasizes the need to focus on process integrity, safety, and reliability rather than the traditional CIA triad. The speaker provides an overview of purple team options, including tabletop exercises, attack surface assessments, and interactive penetration tests. He concludes by discussing attacker-focused scenarios, such as opportunistic infections, direct disruptions, and ICS integrity attacks, and the importance of recovery, response, and remediation planning.
