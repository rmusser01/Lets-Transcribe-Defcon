The presentation explores the tactics of threat actors who are "living on the edge," leveraging edge devices like routers, firewalls, and virtual machine hypervisors to gain persistent access to target environments. This shift in intrusion methodology poses challenges for blue teams due to limited visibility and the absence of EDR solutions on these devices. The presentation analyzes real-world use cases, such as APT31's Packdoor malware and Mandiant's report on GRU operations in Ukraine, providing insights into the tradecraft and impact on the kill chain. The speaker offers defense strategies, including hardening, technology-specific measures, and infrastructure tracking, while acknowledging the complexity of remediating such compromises. The comprehensive bulleted notes provide a structured overview of the presentation, covering topics such as threat actor motivations, targeted technologies, defense strategies, and the historical evolution of edge device compromises.
