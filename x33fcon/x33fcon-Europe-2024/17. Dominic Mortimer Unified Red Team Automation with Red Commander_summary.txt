Dominic Mortimer, a Red Team specialist, presents "Unified Red Team Automation with Red Commander," a web-based tool that simplifies and centralizes Red Team infrastructure deployment and management. The challenges of managing complex Red Team infrastructure are addressed by Red Commander, which provides a user-friendly interface for controlling and deploying assets across multiple providers. The tool utilizes Django, Ninja API, Tailscale, and other technologies to create dynamic and secure networks, with a focus on API integration and modular design. The demo showcases the end-to-end process of deploying infrastructure using Red Commander, highlighting its efficiency and flexibility. The tool also offers additional features such as DNS management, project IOCs, op logs, and an op vault for sharing tools and detection rules. The feature roadmap includes Oplog integration, emulation builders, LLM integration, and CICD pipelines. The infrastructure and project module will be released towards the end of the year, with future plans to keep the tool closed-source while continuously adding new features.
