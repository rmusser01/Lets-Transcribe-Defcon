Kuba Grecki, an offensive security tools developer, presents an updated version of Evil Jinx, a reverse phishing framework. The new version, Evil Jinx Pro, aims to address the challenges faced by red teams in setting up, maintaining, and evading detection. Grecki highlights the need for red teams to have better tools than black-hat hackers and introduces a vetted community, BreakDev Red, for red teamers to share tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) securely. Evil Jinx Pro features a client-server architecture, multi-user collaboration, improved TLS certificate handling, automated JavaScript obfuscation, and enhanced bot detection using JA4 signatures and browser telemetry analysis. Grecki also demonstrates Evil Puppet, a module that extracts shadow tokens from legitimate browser sessions. The talk concludes with a live demo of Evil Jinx Pro, showcasing its capabilities and ease of use.
