## Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) Attack Paths in BloodHound:

- ADCS is Microsoft's native PKI solution, used for smart card authentication, TLS certificate management, and more.
- BloodHound, a tool for analyzing and visualizing attack paths in Active Directory, has been expanded to include ADCS attack paths. 
- The data model, including nodes and edges, is key to understanding how BloodHound identifies and analyzes these attack paths. 
- Escalation 1, 3, and 4 are demonstrated, showing how attackers can exploit ADCS configurations to escalate privileges and impersonate users. 
- Remediation strategies are discussed, including limiting enrollment rights to TLS principles and using enrollment agents with granular permissions. 
- BloodHound provides an accurate, automatic, and accessible way to identify and analyze ADCS attack paths, helping defenders secure their systems.
