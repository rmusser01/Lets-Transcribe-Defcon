In the talk, "Hiding Payloads in Plain .text," the speaker, Mo Sommers, a red team operator at Inviso, presents a tool called "Codasm" for evading a particular EDR detection vector related to high file entropy. After introducing the steps involved in building a payload and explaining the concept of entropy, they focus on the Portable Executable (PE) file format and explore various sections where payloads can be hidden. The text section, containing assembly instructions, is identified as a potential hiding place due to its naturally high entropy. To reduce the entropy of the payload, Sommers proposes encoding it into pseudo-assembly instructions, ensuring it blends with legitimate code. They demonstrate the "Codasm" tool, which generates source code with encoded payload, and discuss its effectiveness, trade-offs, and potential improvements. The talk concludes with lessons learned and suggestions for further research and tool enhancements.
