- The presentation outlines techniques for red teams to maintain persistence, evade EDRs, and connect to existing C2 environments, while also offering insights for blue teams to detect these tactics.
- Rootkit methodologies, including hiding injected DLLs, dumping credentials, and removing kernel callbacks, are demonstrated with code examples.
- The speaker showcases the integration of their rootkit, Nidhogg, with the Mythic C2 agent, Athena, for a real-world red team engagement scenario.
- Detection methods for common rootkit techniques, such as kernel callback tampering and IRP hooking, are proposed, including periodic scanning and identifying mismatched or disabled callbacks.
- The talk concludes with a live demo and a release of the code used.
