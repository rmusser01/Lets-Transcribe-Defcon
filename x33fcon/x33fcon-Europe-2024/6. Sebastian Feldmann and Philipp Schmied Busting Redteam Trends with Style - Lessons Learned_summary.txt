**Talk by Sebastian Feldmann and Philipp Schmied**: They introduce a custom Sysmon replacement, a security sensor called "Weasel," built from scratch using ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) to fingerprint state-of-the-art threat actors and red team trends. 

**Why a Custom Security Sensor?**: Discusses the limitations of relying on third-party sensors, including the inability to customize events, add new events, or enrich existing ones. They highlight the importance of reliable and context-rich telemetry for effective detection rule writing, hunting attacker activities, and incident response. 

**ETW and Sysmon Replacement**: Explains the challenges of implementing all Sysmon events using ETW, including performance issues, missing telemetry, and difficulties with short-lived processes. They explore the idea of using kernel-level telemetry and the Sysmon driver but encounter performance issues on multi-user systems. 

**Discovery of SAC Provider**: They discover the SAC (Microsoft Windows Sec) provider, which offers raw telemetry similar to Sysmon but with events forwarded via ETW. This provider is enabled when onboarded to MDE (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint). They gain access to it using the autologger feature, which allows them to bypass permission checks. 

**Weasel Security Sensor**: They introduce Weasel, their custom security sensor built using the SAC provider as the baseline. Weasel supports 22 enriched and customizable events, including Sysmon events and additional ones like AMSI, RPC, and .NET assembly loaded. It runs as a background service, writing into the Windows event log, and allows for fine-tuned event filters via a config file. 

**Built-in Detections and Process Rating**: Weasel includes built-in detections for techniques like module proxying, direct and indirect system calls, and call stack normalization. It also implements process rating, where it observes process behavior and scans for IOCs, such as optimal memory allocations and thread states, to identify potential offensive tools or injected beacons. 

**IOC Tags and Customizable Events**: Weasel adds IOC tags to events, indicating suspicious activities like direct system calls, indirect system calls, and module proxying. It also allows for customizable events with Boolean operations and per-field configurations. 

**Sleep Masks and Call Stack Spoofing**: They discuss the detection of sleep masks, including APC-based and timer-based ones, by analyzing call stacks and enumerating pending timers. They also mention the challenge of call stack spoofing and how they detect certain ROP gadgets in the call stack as an indicator of potential spoofing. 

**Summary**: Emphasizes the benefits of a custom security sensor, the challenges of relying on third-party sensors, and the effectiveness of fine-grained detection mechanisms. They plan to continue enhancing Weasel with improved protections and more events.
