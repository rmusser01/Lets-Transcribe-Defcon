**Pawel Partyka: Unraveling and Countering Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) Phishing Attacks**

**Introduction:**
- AiTM phishing attacks are becoming prevalent, causing significant damage.
- The session will cover analysis, detection, and prevention methods.

**Threat Overview:**
- Phishing-as-a-service offerings: threat actors provide tools, services, and support to affiliates.
- Segmentation and democratization of cybercrime economy lowered the barrier for low-skilled criminals.
- Most attacks are opportunistic, but nation-state actors also use phishing-as-a-service.

**History and Evolution of AiTM:**
- Evil Jinx (2017): open-source, free tool mainly used by red teamers.
- 2021: Evil Proxy reshaped the market with powerful support and tutorials.
- 2022: Naked Pages, another prolific kit; Microsoft blogged about AiTM and business email compromise.
- Traditional phishing still exists but AiTM leveraging kits are more common, especially with MFA adoption.

**Types of AiTM:**
- Standard Reverse Proxy: session proxied through VPS hosting the kit.
- Synchronous Relay: more complex infrastructure with centralized phishing-as-a-service platform.

**Standard Reverse Proxy Kits:**
- Evil Jinx, Evil Proxy, Naked Pages, serverless functions (Cloudflare workers, Azure functions).
- Sign-in patterns: device remote connection IP matches IDP-facing IP, unfamiliar location/user agent/browser.
- Referrer field in sign-in logs may reveal phishing site URL.

**Everyproxy:**
- Signs into Office 365, empty resource, autoclicks "Keep me signed in."
- Redirects to example.com, refreshes stolen cookies using unusual OAuth endpoint.

**Evil Proxy Statistics:**
- Hosted on GhostNet, Hostinger, and DigitalOcean; 3,375 Telegram subscribers.

**Naked Pages:**
- Redirects to Microsoft Privacy Statement site, IP matching, protected by Cloudflare turnstile.
- Ceased operation on May 26, new offering (Sakai Pages) invited customers.

**Synchronous Relay Kits:**
- Tycoon, Greatness, Caffeine, Rockstar 2FA (.sec).
- More complex infrastructure, residential proxies rotate IP addresses.

**Tycoon Characteristics:**
- Rotates user agent, signs into Office Home, protected by Cloudflare turnstile.

**Caffeine:**
- Different user agents for login and MFA, signs into Office Home.

**Greatness:**
- Static correlation ID and nonce (rotated by Microsoft).

**AITM Prevention and Detection:**
- Invest in advanced anti-phishing solutions that actively scan sites.
- Conditional access policies in identity providers can prevent AiTM.
- Risk-based access policies: unfamiliarity model identifies unusual sign-ins.
- Require compliant devices, token protection, or 502 passkeys (phish-resistant MFA).
- Enter ID Secure Service Edge is a solution.

**Passkeys:**
- 502 credentials stored on various devices (authenticator app, security key) for passwordless auth or 2FA.
- Stored info: domain/UPN, private/public key; triggered for specific identity provider URLs.
- Passkeys prevent successful phishing with Evil Jinx, Caffeine, and Tycoon.

**Demo:**
- Evil Jinx instance: user with compliant device requirement blocks access.
- User with passkey priority: unable to sign in, error when attempting FIDO2 authentication.
- Live phishing pages (Tycoon, synchronous relay): unable to select passkey, redirected to non-existent site.

**Detection and Prevention in Action:**
- XDR solutions with multiple signals are effective for AiTM detection.
- Simple detection: user click followed by sign-in from the same IP triggers alert.
- Automatic attack disruption: disable user account upon high-confidence detection.

**Real-World Example:**
- Swedish customer received phishing email with link to AiTM Tycoon website.
- User clicked, signed in with MFA via text message (medium and high-risk sign-ins).
- Account was disabled, preventing further attack progression.

**Conclusion:**
- AiTM phishing attacks are prevalent and cause significant damage.
- Understanding the threat landscape, detection, and prevention methods is crucial.
- XDR solutions with multiple signals can effectively detect and disrupt AiTM attacks.
