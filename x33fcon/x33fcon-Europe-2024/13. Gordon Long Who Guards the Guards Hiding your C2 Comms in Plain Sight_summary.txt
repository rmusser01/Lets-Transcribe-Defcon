In this talk, Gordon Long explores techniques for hiding C2 communications on Windows systems. He begins by discussing the challenges posed by EDR tools, which use user-land or kernel-based hooks for detection. To evade these defenses, Long suggests employing a "stage zero" approach with minimal on-disk functionality and dynamic loading of post-exploitation modules. He then explains the limitations of named pipes for C2 communications and introduces the concept of using memory, specifically page guard permissions, for data storage. Long demonstrates how to allocate memory regions with page guard permissions, store data, and retrieve it using a custom C2 framework. He also addresses limitations, such as size constraints, and proposes a technique called "guard stomping" to write data into existing page guard regions. Finally, he suggests combining these methods with other evasion techniques and provides resources for further exploration. The code demonstrated in the talk will be made available on GitHub.
