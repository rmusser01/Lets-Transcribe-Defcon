In this presentation, the speaker discusses the challenges of securing software supply chains and proposes a new approach to addressing this problem. The main idea is to create a standard format for defining and exchanging information about the expected behavior of software. This format, called Indicators of Normality (ION), would allow vendors to provide detailed specifications of their software's behavior in a machine-readable and human-readable way. ION rules would cover network behavior, file system access, execution permissions, and more, providing a comprehensive profile of expected software behavior. This approach aims to improve security by enabling easy verification of software behavior and facilitating the integration of security solutions. The speaker also highlights the limitations of current security measures, such as code signing and hash publication, and emphasizes the need for a community-driven effort to establish ION as a standard.
