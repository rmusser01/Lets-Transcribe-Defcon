In the talk, Golan Cohen discusses a new Zloader campaign that exploits Microsoft's signature verification method. By analyzing the infection chain, Cohen identifies the use of legitimate RMM software and code appended to a file's signature while maintaining validity. The presentation includes a demonstration of the vulnerability, highlighting its potential for code execution, delivery, and data exfiltration. With over 2000 victims, the campaign's impact is significant, and the research leads to important defensive strategies, including the application of Microsoft's fix for signature verification. The notes emphasize key terms and topics, providing a structured overview of the discussion.
