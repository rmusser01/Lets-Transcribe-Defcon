**Presentation Overview:**
- Speaker: Paul Coggin, Huntsville, Alabama, US.
- Topic: Space and Cybersecurity, focusing on ground systems, cloud integration, and emerging trends.

**Ground Systems:**
- Ground stations act as NOC/SOC for space systems, enabling communication, data download, and command transmission.
- Trend towards utilizing public cloud services like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google for ground station operations.
- Space systems are also moving to the cloud, with companies like Leo Cloud putting data centers on satellites for in-space data processing.
- Radiation-hardened storage solutions are being developed to address the harsh space environment.
- Potential for data centers on the moon and satellite constellations with interconnected storage.

**Space and Cybersecurity:**
- Threats to space include deception, temporary disruption, denial of service, degradation, and destruction, with varying levels of reversibility.
- Offensive strategies may target ground stations, VPN/firewall, or attempt satellite communication.
- Stuxnet malware affected a satellite in India, disabling its solar panels.
- Solar storms and cosmic rays can cause disruptions, leading to potential encryption issues due to radiation-induced single event upsets.
- Many satellite communications are unencrypted, leaving them vulnerable to eavesdropping and spoofing.
- Malware like Turtle and ransomware attacks have targeted satellites.
- Limited real-world examples of sat-to-sat attacks, but it remains a potential future vector.

**Examples of Satellite Hacks:**
- INSAT-4B, Rosette, Landsat 7, Terra, and weather satellites have been compromised, with varying levels of control and impact.
- SkyNet military satellite held for ransom in 1999.
- Accidental malware introductions on the International Space Station via thumb drive and laptop.
- Raspberry Pi plugged into an open network port for data theft.

**Best Practices and Standards:**
- International committees develop protocols, encryption standards, and best practices for space architectures.
- NIST, CISA, SEC, and Germany have released guidelines for securing space systems.
- Emphasis on DevSecOps, supply chain monitoring, and incorporating security into systems engineering and design.

**Tools and Resources:**
- NASA Core Flight System, Cosmos, NASA 42 Space Simulator, NOS 3, Artemis, Sat NOGS, and Icarus for space system simulation and modeling.
- CubeSats for practical implementation.

**Conclusion:**
- Space cybersecurity is a rapidly evolving field with unique challenges and potential threats.
- Incorporating security measures into systems engineering, utilizing available tools, and adhering to best practices are crucial for protecting space assets.
