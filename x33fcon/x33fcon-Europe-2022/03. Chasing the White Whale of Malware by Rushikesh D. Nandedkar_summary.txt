In this talk, Rushikesh D. Nandedkar discusses the challenges of analyzing Operational Technology (OT) binaries, which are often custom-made and have low visibility, making it difficult to obtain information about their functionality. He proposes a set of "tests of deduction" to determine if a binary is cyber-physical relevant and potentially malicious. These tests include examining static and dynamic strings, searching for specific functions and API calls, device probes, and network behavior. By automating these tests, analysts can efficiently sort through large numbers of samples and focus on those with cyber-physical relevance. The speaker also highlights the importance of establishing benchmarks and reducing clutter in the analysis process.
