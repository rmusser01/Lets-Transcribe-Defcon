The talk focuses on strategies for detecting and hunting Command-and-Control (C2) beacons used by both open-source and commercial post-exploitation frameworks. The presenter, Dominic Chell, outlines generic but effective strategies for detection, including behavior analysis, in-memory analysis, and network interaction. Chell also introduces a tool called "Beacon Hunter," which is designed to detect beacons and will be open-sourced. The presentation includes a demonstration of "Beacon Hunter" and a detailed analysis of two popular C2 frameworks: Cobalt Strike and Brute Retail. Chell highlights the customizable nature of Cobalt Strike and the challenges it poses for detection, while Brute Retail's less customizable nature makes it easier to build detections. Through code examples and live demonstrations, Chell showcases how to identify and exploit specific behaviors, memory footprints, and network indicators to detect and hunt beacons. The talk concludes with a summary of the "Beacon Hunter" tool's capabilities and a list of references for further reading on detection techniques and evasion strategies.
