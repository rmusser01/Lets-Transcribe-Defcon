Christopher Peacock, an expert in cyber security, presents a talk on expanding David Bianco's Pyramid of Pain, termed the TTP Pyramid. The discussion covers the evolution of cyber intelligence, with a focus on understanding and countering adversary procedures. Peacock highlights the limitations of traditional approaches like antivirus software and the need to study human elements within attacks. He introduces the concept of the "procedure level," which involves analyzing and replicating specific actions taken by adversaries during an attack. By understanding these procedures, organizations can improve their detection and response capabilities. Peacock provides examples of extracting procedure-level intelligence from various sources, such as incident reports, honeypots, and sandboxing. He emphasizes the importance of collaboration between red and blue teams to adapt and break detections. Finally, he introduces the Purple Team Exercise Framework, a free resource for organizations to improve their cyber defense strategies.
