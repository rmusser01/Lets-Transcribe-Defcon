**Introduction to Red Teaming macOS Environments**:
- Presenter, Wojciech Regula, highlights the increasing presence of Macs in corporate environments, often unsecured compared to Windows machines.
- Macs are no longer niche, with developers, designers, and managers all using them.
- The talk aims to showcase typical red-teaming attack scenarios applicable to both Windows and Macs.

**Comparing Macs in Corporate Environments**:
- Macs can be bound to Active Directory (AD) or use alternatives like Nomad for Kerberos.
- Some companies opt for cloud services and Single Sign-On (SSO) without AD.

**Target Environment**:
- A Mac connects to the company's intranet and AD, providing access to SSO services, JIRA, Google Workspace, and AWS.
- Social media accounts, Signal messages, and sensitive documents are also potential targets.

**Choosing a Command-and-Control (C2) Framework**:
- Mythic, an open-source C2 framework by Cody Thomas, is recommended for macOS red teaming due to its extensive documentation.

**Initial Access and Persistence**:
- Notarization is required for macOS applications to prevent malware, but there are ways to bypass it.
- A zero-day vulnerability in macro sandboxing systems allows code execution without user consent.
- Various persistence techniques are available, such as launch agents, launch daemons, login items, and cron jobs.

**Attacking Services and Data Collection**:
- OpenVPN profiles may contain user credentials, and code injection can be used to keylog VPN logins.
- Nomad credentials are stored in macOS Keychain, which has a flaw allowing access without additional prompts.
- Signal messages are encrypted, but the decryption key is stored in a flat file, making them accessible.
- Firefox stores saved logins and passwords, which can be dumped without root access.

**TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) Bypasses**:
- TCC protects sensitive resources like desktop, documents, camera, and microphone with user consent.
- There are TCC bypasses, but a better trick is abusing applications already installed with required permissions, like Microsoft Teams.
- SSH with full disk access bypasses TCC, and a local SSH key can be added to access sensitive resources.

**Lateral Movement**:
- SSH keys, AWS/Azure/Google Cloud credentials, and other sensitive data are often stored in the home directory, accessible without TCC.

**Recommendations for Hardening macOS Environments**:
- Enroll Macs in MDM (Mobile Device Management) for centralized management.
- Keep Macs updated to patch vulnerabilities.
- Enforce policies like System Integrity Protection, firewall, Gatekeeper, and FileVault.
- Disable Word macros if not used.
- Install anti-malware solutions.
- Monitor for zero-days and vulnerabilities.

**Summary**:
- Macs can be infected and are not inherently more secure than Windows.
- They should not be a blind spot in corporate security strategies.
- Following recommended security practices and staying updated can help secure macOS environments.
