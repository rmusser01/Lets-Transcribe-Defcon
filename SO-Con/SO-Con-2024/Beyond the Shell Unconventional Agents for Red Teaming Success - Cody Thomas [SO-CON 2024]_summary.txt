Cody Thomas, a macOS researcher, red teamer, teacher, and software engineer at SpectreOps, presents an overview of the Mythic C2 framework and its unconventional agents for red teaming success. He begins by introducing Mythic, an open-source C2 framework with a microservice architecture, collaborative web UI, and various agents contributed by the community. He then explains the standard operational flow of selecting a C2 framework, installing agents, generating payloads, and detonating them on target. 

To make web shells more conducive to C2 platform tasking, Thomas introduces the Arachne agent for Mythic, which supports AES-256 HMAC encryption and commands like upload, download, execute, etc. He demonstrates how to create fake callbacks, issue tasks, and handle peer-to-peer connections for web shells that are not publicly accessible. 

Thomas also explores the concept of third-party service agents and how they can improve collaboration and reduce duplicated entry. He showcases how Mythic can interact with Ghostwriter, Bloodhound, and Nemesis, popular tools used in red teaming engagements. By generating user-specific API tokens and telling Mythic where these tools reside, operators can manipulate findings, objectives, evidence, and reports in Ghostwriter directly from Mythic. They can also query Bloodhound's API, render graphs and nodes, and task other callbacks based on the data returned by Bloodhound. Additionally, they can query Nemesis' API to access processed data, upload files, and push data for further manipulation. 

Thomas concludes by emphasizing the benefits of per-user access, graph or API-level access, automatic tracking, collaboration, and the open-source nature of these third-party integrations. He invites the audience to try out the Arachne, Ghostwriter, Bloodhound, and Nemesis agents, which are all available on the Mythic Meta website, and encourages contributions through pull requests.
