The talk explores the evolving nature of cyber attacks and how they have adapted to the widespread adoption of SaaS and remote work. The traditional cyber kill chain, which included phases like reconnaissance, port scanning, and vulnerability exploitation, has morphed into a model focused on endpoint compromise. However, with the shift to SaaS and remote work, the speaker argues that cloud identity has become the new perimeter. This presents new challenges and opportunities for attackers. The presentation covers various attack techniques, including recon, initial access, persistence, execution, and lateral movement, all adapted for the SaaS environment. The speaker also introduces a SaaS attacks matrix, a MITRE-style framework for understanding and defending against these new types of attacks. Overall, the talk highlights the need for security professionals to adapt their strategies and tools to address the changing nature of cyber threats.
