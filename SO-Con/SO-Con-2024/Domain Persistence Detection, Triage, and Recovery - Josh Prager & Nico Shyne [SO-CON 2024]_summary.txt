In this presentation, Joshua Prager and Niko Schein from Specter Ops discuss domain persistence techniques, their detection, and recovery strategies. They emphasize the impact of domain persistence on organizational security and the need for vigilant monitoring and securing of domains. The talk covers credential theft on domain controllers, NTDS access, DCSync, Golden and Diamond Tickets, certificate theft, and SSCM site takeover. The speakers provide insights into detection strategies, including event IDs and system access control lists (SACLs). They also offer a high-level guide to domain recovery, including scoping, reprovisioning domain controllers, rotating accounts and secrets, and enabling additional auditing. The presentation concludes with a Q&A session, and the speakers invite attendees to reach out for further discussions.
