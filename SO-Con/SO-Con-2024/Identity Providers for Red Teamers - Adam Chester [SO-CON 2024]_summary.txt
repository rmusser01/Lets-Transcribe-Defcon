The talk focuses on cloud-based identity providers and common attacks used to target them during red team engagements. The speaker, Adam Chester, shares his experience and demonstrates techniques for exploiting vulnerabilities in popular identity providers like Okta, Ping Identity, OneLogin, and Microsoft Entra ID. He emphasizes the importance of understanding deployment topologies and common scenarios where attackers may gain access to these providers. Chester highlights the logon user W API call, which allows the interception of plain text credentials, and agent spoofing, where attackers emulate the communication protocol between the agent and the identity provider to extract API tokens. He also discusses Kerberos-based attacks, SAML attacks, phishing using identity providers, and the Autofastpass feature in Okta. The presentation includes live demonstrations and offers recommendations for both red and blue teams to improve their capabilities in this area.
