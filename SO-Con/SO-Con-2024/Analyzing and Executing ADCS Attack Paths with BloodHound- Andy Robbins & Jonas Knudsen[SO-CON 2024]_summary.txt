In this talk, Andy Robbins and Jonas Knudsen from SpecterOps discuss the integration of Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) into BloodHound, a tool for analyzing and visualizing attack paths in Active Directory environments. ADCS is Microsoft's implementation of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) used for managing digital certificates. They explain the components of ADCS, including root Certificate Authorities (CAs), enterprise CAs, and certificate templates, and how they are materialized in BloodHound. They introduce new node types and edges in BloodHound to represent ADCS objects and their relationships. They also demonstrate how to use BloodHound to discover, analyze, and execute attack paths that traverse ADCS infrastructure, specifically the "Escalation 1" privilege escalation vulnerability. They show how BloodHound simplifies the process of identifying and exploiting these attack paths, reducing the friction for red teamers and defenders. Additionally, they highlight the new findings and remediation recommendations available in BloodHound Enterprise related to ADCS vulnerabilities. The presentation includes a live demo of discovering and executing an attack path using BloodHound and other tools.
