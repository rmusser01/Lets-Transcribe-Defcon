In this talk, Matt Creel and Adam Brown discuss how red team operators can manually enumerate Active Directory attack paths with BOFHound, a tool they developed, while avoiding detection. They cover the challenges of mapping Active Directory without BloodHound's aid, and provide an overview of common SharpHound detection strategies. They also demonstrate how to use BOFHound to perform granular Active Directory enumeration, and share their future plans for the tool.
