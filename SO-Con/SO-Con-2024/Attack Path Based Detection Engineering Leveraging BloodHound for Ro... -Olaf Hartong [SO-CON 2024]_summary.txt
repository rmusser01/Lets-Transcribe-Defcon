Olaf Hartong, a detection engineer and co-founder of Falcon Force, presents FalconHound, a tool designed to enhance BloodHound's capabilities for blue teams. BloodHound is a powerful tool for identifying and analyzing attack paths, but many blue teams struggle to maximize its potential due to time constraints and knowledge gaps. FalconHound addresses these challenges by providing features such as tracking sessions, environment changes, alerts, and incidents in near real-time. It enables defenders to leverage bi-directional contextual information to prioritize critical alerts and stop attackers in their tracks. FalconHound integrates with various security tools and can be customized to suit specific needs. The tool is open-source, free, and continuously updated based on user feedback and contributions.
