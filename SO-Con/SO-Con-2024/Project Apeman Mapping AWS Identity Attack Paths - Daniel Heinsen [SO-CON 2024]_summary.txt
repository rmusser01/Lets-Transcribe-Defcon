In the realm of cloud security, the automated discovery of identity attack paths has become crucial for mitigating cyber threats. The talk introduces the concept of "Tier 0" security within the AWS ecosystem and presents Apeman, a tool for mapping and visualizing these attack paths. The discussion also highlights the challenges faced during Apeman's development, such as handling resultant sets of policies and conditions. The speaker shares their experience in AWS policy evaluation and the need for automated tooling. They define "Tier 0" in AWS and explain how Apeman helps identify and secure these privileged accounts. The tool's graph-based approach, ability to handle role assumptions, and definition of "Tier 0" paths are highlighted. The speaker also plans to open-source Apeman and encourages further research and discussion on AWS attack paths.
