Jeremy Fox presents KubeHound, a tool for visualising attack paths in Kubernetes deployments. The tool aims to shift the mental model of Kubernetes security from list-based thinking to graph-based thinking. 

Fox begins by outlining the challenges of defending large, ever-evolving environments, before explaining how KubeHound works and demonstrating its capabilities through a series of examples. 

He also discusses the development process of the tool and shares some of the lessons he learned along the way.
