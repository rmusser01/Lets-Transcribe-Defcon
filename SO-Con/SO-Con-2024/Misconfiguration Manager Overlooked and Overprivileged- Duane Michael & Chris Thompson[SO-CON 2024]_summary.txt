In this talk, Chris Thompson and Duane Michael from SpecterOps discuss their research on SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager) attack paths and present a new knowledge base called "Misconfiguration Manager." They start by introducing SCCM, explaining its widespread use in Windows and Active Directory environments for managing software, operating systems, and compliance settings. They highlight why attackers and defenders should care about SCCM, emphasizing its potential impact on domain compromise. The speakers then delve into SCCM terminology, architecture, and the various accounts it utilizes. They explain how SCCM's client push installation and network access account features can be misconfigured, leading to security vulnerabilities. 

The presentation includes real-world stories of SCCM misconfigurations, such as overprivileged accounts, ownership issues with domain join accounts, and the inclusion of domain controllers as SCCM clients. They introduce their "Misconfiguration Manager" project, a living knowledge base that consolidates offensive and defensive techniques, prevention measures, and detection strategies related to SCCM attack paths. The project is structured similarly to MITRE ATT&CK, with categories such as cred, elevate, exec, recon, and takeover. The speakers encourage community contributions and provide resources for further engagement. Overall, the talk offers valuable insights into the potential risks associated with SCCM and provides a comprehensive resource for managing and mitigating these attack paths.
