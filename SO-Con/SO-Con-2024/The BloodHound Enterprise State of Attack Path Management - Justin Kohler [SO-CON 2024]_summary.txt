**Justin Kohler's Talk at SO-CON 2024:**

- Justin Kohler, product leader at Specter Ops, discusses attack path management and BloodHound Enterprise (BHE).
- BHE has become crucial for identity security in organizations, with a focus on continuous and comprehensive risk management.
- Attack Path Management Manifesto: a strategy to break the cycle of reactive vulnerability management.
- Emphasis on proactive visibility, prioritization, step-by-step remediation, and measurable progress.
- Active Directory (AD) environments are complex, with numerous objects and relationships, leading to infinite attack paths.
- Common issues include improper tiering, group nesting, and backup software configurations granting excessive privileges.
- ADCS (Active Directory Certificate Services) vulnerabilities are prevalent and critical, often overlooked during pen testing.
- Attack paths affect all organizations, regardless of size, maturity, or age; common knowledge about AD security is lacking.
- Visualizing attack paths is powerful for AD administration, incident response, mergers/acquisitions, and SOC enrichment.
- Steps for success: treat it as a new capability, build stakeholder buy-in, start small, and focus on choke point analysis.
- Future plans include enhancing enterprise features, continued graph expansion, and improving community contributions.
