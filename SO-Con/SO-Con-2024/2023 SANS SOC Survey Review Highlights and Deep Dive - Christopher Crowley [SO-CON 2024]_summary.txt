Christopher Crowley, a cybersecurity consultant and instructor, presents the findings of the 2023 SANS SOC Survey, which he has authored for seven years. The survey aims to provide insights into the current state of cybersecurity operations and SOCs. With approximately 640 participants, the survey reveals trends such as the average organization size, capabilities, detection methods, metrics used, orchestration automation approaches, data management, budgeting, outsourcing, staffing, and technology satisfaction. Crowley emphasizes the value of career progression in retaining staff and the importance of remote work considerations. He also discusses the challenges of self-identifying SOC roles and the benefits of outsourcing. The presentation includes a demonstration of using JupyterLab to analyze and visualize survey data, encouraging attendees to utilize the released data for their inquiries.
