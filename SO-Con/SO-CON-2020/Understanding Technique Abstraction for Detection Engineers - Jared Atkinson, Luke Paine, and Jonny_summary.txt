In this workshop, the presenters discuss the concept of technique abstraction for detection engineers. They cover topics such as the funnel of fidelity, capability abstraction, detection spectrum, and the importance of understanding attack techniques beyond just the tools used. They provide a step-by-step guide on how to create an abstraction map for service creation, including static and dynamic analysis using tools like IDA Pro, API Monitor, and Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). They emphasize the need for layered detection strategies and comprehensive understanding of attack techniques to build effective detections.
