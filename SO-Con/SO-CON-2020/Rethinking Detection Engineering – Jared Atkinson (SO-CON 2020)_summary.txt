In the talk, "Rethinking Detection Engineering," Jared Atkinson discusses the challenges of false positives and false negatives in cybersecurity threat detection. He proposes a multi-stage detection approach to reduce uncertainty and improve accuracy. Atkinson suggests identifying a base condition and capturing instances of it, adding relevant context, and using multivariate detection to evaluate the likelihood of malicious activity. The process aims to minimize false negatives while managing false positives through improved alert triage. Atkinson's colleague, Jonathan Johnson, demonstrates a practical implementation of this approach using Jupyter notebooks and Splunk. The presentation offers a paradigm shift in detection engineering, emphasizing the need to rethink how we deal with abstract concepts in cybersecurity.
