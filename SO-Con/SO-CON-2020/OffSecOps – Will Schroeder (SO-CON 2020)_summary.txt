In this talk, Will Schroeder, a technical architect at SpectreOps, discusses the benefits of integrating DevOps practices into offensive security operations. He presents an architecture that utilizes Jenkins for building offensive toolsets, Artifactory for storing artifacts, and GitLab for storing build pipelines. By using declarative Jenkins pipelines and parameter pass-throughs, they can ensure unique builds for each engagement, facilitating tracking and detection of leaked artifacts. Schroeder also highlights the importance of indicator stripping, OPSEC checks, artifact fingerprinting, and project vetting to maintain operational security. The ability to hook into the tool-building process enables creative applications and enhances the overall offensive capabilities.
