**Introduction:**
- Speaker: Justin Bui (Handle: slyd0g)
- Red teamer at Specter Ops with experience in web app pen testing and other security areas. 
- Presentation overview: macOS Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC); languages for post-exploitation on macOS; three tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs): clipboard monitoring, keylogging, and screen capturing; demo of new tool, Swift Spy.

**macOS TCC:**
- Introduced in macOS 10.14 Mojave and expanded in 10.15 Catalina.
- Acts as privacy controls, sandboxing apps, and preventing them from accessing specific data or functionality.
- Requires user consent through pop-ups for certain actions, which can be managed in security settings.

**Languages for Post-Exploitation on macOS:**
- Swift, Golang, Python 3, Objective-C, AppleScript, JavaScript for Automation (JXA), and C/C++.
- Swift chosen for direct access to macOS APIs and OS-specific support.

**MITRE ATT&CK for macOS:**
- Standard reference for TTPs, categorized as initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, etc. 
- Speaker's interest in clipboard data (TTP) and desire to implement it on macOS.

**Clipboard Monitoring:**
- MITRE ATT&CK entry mentions 'pbpaste' command but speaker focuses on API-level implementation.
- Determining the current user's active application is key context for attackers, achievable through NotificationCenter class and NS notifications.
- NSPasteboard class is used for clipboard interaction, requiring polling due to lack of specific messages for changes. 

**Keylogging:**
- Valuable for gathering user input and activity.
- Utilizes IOHidManager API to interact with Human Interface Devices (HID).
- Requires input monitoring permissions from TCC.
- API calls for keylogging: IOHidManager Create, SetDeviceMatching, register input value callback, open, and schedule with run loop.
- Callback function processes events, identifying key presses and releases, and their values. 

**Screen Capturing:**
- Core Graphics API is used, requiring screen recording permission from TCC.
- cgGetActiveDisplayList, cgDisplayCreateImage, and related APIs are employed to capture images of active displays and save them. 

**Swift Spy Tool:**
- Incorporates clipboard monitoring, keylogging, and screen capturing functionality.
- Written in Swift, the code is available on the speaker's GitHub.
- Includes keylog, clipboard, and screenshot modules, with options for continuous screenshot capture. 

**Demo:**
- Swift Spy is demonstrated, showcasing its keylog, clipboard, and screenshot capabilities. 
- TCC permissions are highlighted as necessary for certain functions, and the output of each module is displayed. 

**Conclusion:**
- Shout-outs to Cody Thomas and Chris Ross for macOS guidance.
