In the talk, "Six Degrees of Global Admin," Andy Robbins, co-creator of Bloodhound, introduces Bloodhound 4.0, a tool for identifying attack paths in Active Directory and Azure. He acknowledges prior work in this area and provides a refresher on Azure's architecture. The new data collector for Bloodhound 4.0, Azure Hound, is introduced, which collects data on Azure Active Directory and Azure Resource Manager objects. Robbins also showcases the refreshed Bloodhound GUI and demonstrates an example attack path based on real Azure tenants. The attack path involves exploiting an app with a privileged role admin role to promote a user to global admin. Finally, he provides links to download Bloodhound and join the Bloodhound Slack community.
