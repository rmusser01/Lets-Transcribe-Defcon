The video presents Merlin, a post-exploitation command-and-control tool written in Go, supporting HTTP versions 1.1, 2, and 3. It covers the different HTTP versions and their features, including head-of-line blocking in HTTP 1.1 and the introduction of multiplexing in HTTP2. The speaker also discusses the QUIC protocol, which forms the basis for HTTP3, and its advantages, such as zero round-trip time and connection migration. Merlin uses the OPAQUE key exchange protocol for authentication, and its traffic is encrypted using JSON Web Encryption (JWE) and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The tool offers features like tab completion, host system command execution, and dynamic JA3 hash modification for evasion. The presentation includes demonstrations on building custom Merlin agents, domain fronting using Amazon CloudFront CDN, bypassing Windows Defender, and changing the JA3 fingerprint to evade detection.
