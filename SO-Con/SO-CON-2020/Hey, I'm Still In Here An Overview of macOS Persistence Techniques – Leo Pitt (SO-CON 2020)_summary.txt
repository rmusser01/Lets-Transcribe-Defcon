- The presentation offers an overview of modern macOS persistence techniques, highlighting less commonly known methods. 
- Leo Pitt, a consultant at Spectrops with a background in IT auditing, Linux administration, and red/blue team operations, introduces the topic and provides a brief history of macOS persistence. 
- macOS persistence is crucial for Red Team operations to maintain access after initial infiltration. 
- Launch agents and daemons are the most common but also well-detected methods; the talk focuses on alternative approaches. 
- A comparison of Windows and macOS terms sets the stage for discussing macOS-specific concepts like property lists (plists), executables, and endpoint security framework (ESF) events. 
- Persistence techniques covered include Bash/Z-Shell profiles, Cron jobs, Dock shortcuts, Finder sync plugins, application scripts, and third-party plugins. 
- Each technique is explained with examples, and detection methods are suggested, leveraging ESF events, process monitoring, and file creation/modification tracking. 
- Automation is demonstrated using JXA (JavaScript for Automation) to achieve persistence with the AppVal agent for Mythic C2 framework. 
- A live demo showcases the process of creating a malicious dylib and a sublime text editor plugin for persistence, resulting in a successful callback. 
- Additional macOS persistence methods are mentioned, including launch agents, login items, folder actions, dylib hijacking, Emond persistence, Periodics, At jobs, Chrome extensions, Spotlight/audio plugins, login/logout hooks, and calendar events. 
- The presentation concludes with contact information and references to tools, blogs, and further resources for the discussed techniques.
