- **Introduction**: Max Harley introduces the concept of "Offensive JA3", a red team technique derived from JA3, a blue team method for fingerprinting TLS clients. JA3 analyzes the encryption options in the TLS ClientHello packet, providing better detection of malicious traffic compared to HTTP's User-Agent header.
- **JA3 Explanation**: JA3 identifies clients by their unique TLS ClientHello packet parameters, which are typically consistent for specific client libraries. This allows blue teamers to profile SSL/TLS clients on their network.
- **JA3 Transport Project**: Harley, along with Matt Rinaldi, created the JA3 Transport project, a library that enables easy spoofing of JA3 signatures. It utilizes Go's HTTP transport object and the utls library to customize the ClientHello packet. The project aims to make spoofing JA3 signatures as simple as changing the user agent string.
- **Satellite Project**: Satellite is a payload hosting web server that facilitates payload keying. It allows red teamers to control who can access their payloads by whitelisting or blacklisting user agents, IPs, headers, and countries. It also supports global conditionals, enabling centralized management of multiple rulesets.
- **Combining JA3 and Satellite**: By controlling JA3 signatures with JA3 Transport and keying payloads with Satellite, red teamers can protect their payloads and proxy traffic. This adds an extra layer of protection, making it harder for blue teamers to reverse-engineer payloads or discover C2 infrastructure.
- **Call to Action**: Harley encourages the expansion of JA3 Transport to other languages and its implementation in red team tools. He also promotes the use of Satellite, highlighting its potential for enhancing payload delivery and evasion.
