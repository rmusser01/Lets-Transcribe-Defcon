In the talk, "Phishing in a Macro-less World," Daniel Heinsen explores alternative methods for office document exploitation, specifically focusing on four technologies: field codes, ActiveX, OLE-embedded objects, and smart documents. He provides an overview of each technology's common usage, malicious usage, detection, defense, and potential areas for further research. Field codes, used for templatization and automation, can be exploited to leak NTLM v2 hashes or data and may offer a way to bypass warning messages. ActiveX, a rebrand of OLE, can be used to initialize VBA and execute code through Microsoft form controls. Embedded objects, particularly Packager objects, allow the inclusion of arbitrary files in documents and offer a vast attack surface for exploitation. Smart documents, an old and poorly documented feature, provide native Win32 code execution upon document open. Heinsen emphasizes the importance of understanding OLE for effective office document exploitation and encourages responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.
