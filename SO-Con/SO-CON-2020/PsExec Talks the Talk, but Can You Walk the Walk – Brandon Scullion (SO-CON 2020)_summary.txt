**Brandon Scullion's Talk on PsExec at SO-CON 2020**

- Brandon Scullion, a senior detection consultant at SpecterOps, presented research on PsExec lateral movement and potential detection strategies at SO-CON 2020.
- PsExec, a Microsoft Sysinternals utility, is often used by adversaries for lateral movement and can leave a log trail.
- Scullion's talk focused on understanding PsExec's underlying technology, identifying defender blind spots, and developing detection and prevention strategies.
- Key findings included process creation events, unique network connections, and file creations in admin shares.
- Detection strategy involved correlating file creation events on admin shares with network events over port 135 and process events.
- Prevention considerations included disabling RPC and SMB ports, using secure remote connection methods, and auditing admin share policies.
- Research highlighted the importance of understanding underlying technologies when building detections and provided insights into potential future research directions.
