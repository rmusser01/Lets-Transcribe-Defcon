Christopher Maddalena, Managing Consultant at SpectreOps, presents Ghostwriter, a red team management solution designed to streamline project data and asset organization. Ghostwriter acts as a dedicated team member, efficiently managing essential data, evidence files, project metadata, and assignments. It offers a knowledge base for easy reference and linking of information. The platform has been updated to version 2.0, with enhanced backend architecture and improved UI for managing client and project information. Domain and server tracking features help monitor infrastructure usage and availability. Automated activity logging via WebSockets and REST API integration provide real-time updates on team activities. The reporting engine now includes a findings library, improved WYSIWYG editor, and dynamic Word document rendering using Jinja2. Future developments include objective and scope tracking, expanded REST API, and enhanced tool connectivity. Ghostwriter aims to simplify red team operations and improve reporting consistency.
