Cody Thomas and Josiah Massari, operators at SpecterOps, present a workshop on creating a custom Mythic agent. They discuss the benefits of using Mythic, a red team framework, and provide an overview of its architecture. They explain how to create a payload type container, build an agent, and handle tasking and responses. They also cover C2 profiles, dynamic loading of commands, and hooking features. The Hercules agent, a PowerShell-based agent, is used as an example.
