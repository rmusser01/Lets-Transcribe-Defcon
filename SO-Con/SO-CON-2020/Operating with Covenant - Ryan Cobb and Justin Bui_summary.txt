Ryan Cobb and Justin Bui, operators and red teamers at SpecterOps, host a workshop on Operating with Covenant, a collaborative .NET C2 framework for red teamers. They begin by introducing themselves and the agenda for the workshop, which includes an overview of Covenant, a demo, and a lab. 

Cobb and Bui then proceed to demonstrate how to set up Covenant, generate listeners and payloads, and interact with the file system. They also showcase various tasks that can be performed using Covenant, such as uploading and downloading files, running PowerShell and assembly commands, and using keyloggers. 

The presenters also discuss credential management and show how to use Mimikatz and Rubius to extract credentials and Kerberos tickets. They explain the concept of peer-to-peer communication in Covenant and how it can be used for lateral movement within a network. They then provide a live demonstration of this feature, as well as an unrestricted delegation scenario. 

The workshop concludes with a discussion on the extensibility of Covenant, including custom tasks, C2 profiles, and implant templates. They also briefly mention .NET Core implants and how they can be used with Covenant.
