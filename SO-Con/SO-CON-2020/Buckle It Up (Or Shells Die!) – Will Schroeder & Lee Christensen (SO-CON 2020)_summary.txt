In the talk, "Buckle It Up (Or Shells Die!)", Will Schroeder and Lee Christensen emphasize the importance of host situational awareness in offensive security engagements. They introduce Seatbelt, a tool for collecting host-based artifacts relevant to offensive and defensive security. The tool covers over 100 commands and is designed to be modular and extensible. Host situational awareness data informs the techniques, tools, and attack strategies used during an engagement, helping operators make risk-based decisions and remain evasive. The data collected by Seatbelt includes defensive enumeration, attack surface analysis, credential theft, and user/system behavioral baselining. The speakers provide examples of how this data can influence persistence, lateral movement, and exploit development choices. They also demonstrate a walkthrough of how host-based situational awareness data can guide the attack process, from initial access to lateral movement.
