- The 2000 Florida elections highlighted the problems with voting systems in the US, leading to the proposal of electronic voting as a solution.
- Commercial voting vendors made promises of secure electronic voting systems, but these claims were unverifiable due to the closed nature of the software.
- The need for independent verification led to the emergence of the full disclosure movement, where bugs in closed software were exposed.
- Electronic voting systems lack a paper trail, making it difficult to detect tampering and verify votes.
- The Berkeley online election system, used to elect the student government, is studied as an example of a real-scale open-source voting system.
- The system consisted of a ballot server, an authentication layer, and polling stations, with security relying heavily on CalNet, Berkeley's Kerberos authentication system.
- The system had several vulnerabilities, including physical access to the ballot server, an exposed database, and the potential for man-in-the-middle attacks on polling stations.
- A man-in-the-middle attack on the system is described, highlighting the ease of acquiring and replaying CalNet tokens to cast fraudulent votes.
- Lessons learned from the attack include the need for better security practices, the importance of open-source systems, and the potential for similar attacks on commercial systems.
- Commercial electronic voting systems face similar issues, such as closed code, lack of paper trails, and insecure transmission of votes.
- The presentation concludes with recommendations for improving voting system security, including endorsing verifiedvoting.org's resolution, writing to Congress, and encouraging the use of open-source systems.
