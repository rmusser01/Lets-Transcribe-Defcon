- **Introduction:** The speaker discusses the importance of host-based intrusion prevention on Windows and Unix, emphasizing the need for preserving system integrity. He acknowledges the contributions of various individuals and tools related to the topic.
- **Motivation:** The speaker uses an SSH exploit example to demonstrate the vulnerability of trusted applications. By altering system call behavior, intrusion prevention techniques can enhance security by blocking specific exploit payloads.
- **Layered Security:** Comparing host security to network security, the speaker highlights the importance of each layer's integrity. Additional layers, such as intrusion prevention, complement existing security measures like firewalls and antivirus software.
- **Contextual Information:** Intrusion prevention utilizes contextual information (e.g., network/user identity, application state, workflow) to create signatures specific to exploit behavior. This approach is independent of transport and injection methods, providing a unique way to recognize and block exploits.
- **Architectural Similarities:** Windows and Unix have architectural similarities, particularly at the layer between userland and the kernel. This common architecture enables the implementation of system call filtering across different platforms.
- **Rule Creation and Automation:** Current tools allow iterative and interactive rule generation by observing application behavior. However, rule creation is not yet fully automated, requiring some user transparency.
- **System Call Filtering:** System call filtering can reduce an application's interaction with the system and tune system call permissions and semantics. This can decrease the dependency on other security layers.
- **Available Tools:** The speaker mentions tools like Systrace and SERP NG for system call tracing and filtering. Systrace is available for FreeBSD, while SERP NG is a loadable kernel module. Windows has a similar tool called SISTRace.
- **Future Directions:** The speaker suggests creating an API to accommodate different system call filtering implementations, similar to Linus Torvalds' approach with firewalls. This would allow for competition and evolution in the field.
- **Question and Answers:** The speaker answers questions about the availability of Windows ports, rule regeneration for software updates, and the specific implementation details of the Windows tool. The discussion also touches on Microsoft's Longhorn and the messaging vulnerabilities.
