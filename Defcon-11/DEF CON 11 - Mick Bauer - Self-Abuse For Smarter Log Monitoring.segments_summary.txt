- Self-scanning and log monitoring are important techniques for improving security and identifying potential vulnerabilities in a system.
- By running security scanners like Nessus, Nikto, or Nmap against your own system, you can identify areas that need further hardening and understand what attack attempts may look like in your logs.
- Log monitoring tools such as Swatch, Logwatch, and Log Digest can help identify suspicious activity, but it's important to fine-tune their configurations to avoid false positives and excessive resource usage.
- Syslog and Syslog-NG are powerful logging utilities that allow for customizable log handling, including remote logging for improved log integrity.
- Layer 2 attacks and denial-of-service attempts should not be rewarded, as they do not demonstrate skill or creativity.
