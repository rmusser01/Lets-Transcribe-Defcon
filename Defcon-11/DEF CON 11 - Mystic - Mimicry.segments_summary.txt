- Introduction: Mystic introduces the topic of mimicry and its application in data encryption, aiming to disguise encoded data as normal text.
- Mimicry Explanation: Mystic explains mimicry as a method to encrypt data by encoding it within a chosen context-free grammar, ensuring the output appears statistically and grammatically natural.
- Demonstration: Mystic uses a Java applet to demonstrate how an encoded message can be hidden within a baseball game announcement text.
- Context-Free Grammar: Mystic defines context-free grammar as a way to describe language using terminals (static words/phrases), variables, and productions (combinations of variables and terminals).
- MIMIC Functions: MIMIC, created by Peter Wayner, uses context-free grammars to hide binary data by creating a tree of choices, with each leaf encoding specific bits.
- Limitations: Mystic discusses MIMIC's limitations, including the need for unambiguous grammars and the potential for large output sizes.
- RC MIMIC: Mystic introduces their program that applies MIMIC to IRC conversations, allowing for hidden messages within one side of a chat.
- Future Improvements: Mystic suggests enhancements such as bot-to-bot conversations, expanded grammar files, and improved randomness for better security.
- Resources: Mystic provides links and references for further exploration, including the original MIMIC functions, spam mimic, and related websites.
- Conclusion: Mystic concludes the presentation, offering a copy of their program and inviting attendees to a future talk on a related topic.
