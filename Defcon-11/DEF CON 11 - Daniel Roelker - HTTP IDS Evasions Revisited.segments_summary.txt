- **History of HTTP IDS Evasions**: The speaker, Dan Roker, begins by discussing the importance of web attacks and how they have evolved over time. He mentions tools like Whisker and Side Step, which played a significant role in the development of HTTP IDS evasion techniques.
- **Evolution and Current State of IDS and HTTP Evasions**: Roker explains the two main types of IDS (protocol analysis and pattern matching) and how they have adapted to handle HTTP evasions. He notes that the current state of IDS and HTTP evasions is stagnant, leaving room for improvement.
- **Invalid Protocol Parsing and Field Decoding**: Roker delves into two general types of application layer evasions: invalid protocol parsing and invalid protocol field decoding. He emphasizes the importance of understanding application protocols to exploit their lesser-known characteristics.
- **URL Encodings**: The speaker presents nine types of URL encodings that can be used for evasion, including hex encoding, double percent hex encoding, double nibble hex encoding, first/second nibble hex encoding, UTF8 encoding, bare byte encoding, percent U-encoding, and mismatch encoding. These encodings take advantage of quirks in web servers and IDS decoders.
- **Request Pipeline and Parameter Content Encoding Evasions**: Roker introduces two practical application layer evasion techniques: request pipeline and parameter content encoding evasions. Request pipeline evasions involve sending multiple requests in a single packet, while parameter content encoding evasions focus on obscuring malicious parameters in the payload of a POST request.
- **Tools for Evasion**: Roker showcases three tools he has developed: encoder.c, HTTP Chameleon, and MS Unicode Map.c. These tools facilitate the encoding of HTTP URLs, provide a user-friendly GUI, and map code pages and code points on Windows systems, respectively.
- **Q&A Session**: The speaker answers questions from the audience regarding the effectiveness of the evasions, browser recognition, and the limitations of IDS in handling such techniques. He emphasizes the need for IDS to evolve and adapt to counter these evasion methods.
