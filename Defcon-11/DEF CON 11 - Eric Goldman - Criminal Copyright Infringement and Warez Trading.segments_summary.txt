- Defining "Warez Trading": Non-profit dissemination of copyrighted works, typically software, motivated by ideology or hobbyism, distinct from commercial piracy. Four types of "warez traders": distribution groups, collectors, downloaders, and abandoned ware enthusiasts.
- Criminal Copyright Infringement: Requires willful infringement for commercial advantage, private financial gain, or reproduction/distribution of works with a total retail value over $1,000. Punishment includes up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
- Elements of Prosecution: Valid copyright, infringement (copying), connection to an individual, and willfulness. Evidentiary challenges include attributing actions to specific individuals.
- Defenses: First sale defense (weak in digital context) and fair use defense (uncertain due to equitable interpretation).
- Other Criminal Laws: Circumvention of protection devices, hacking/trespass, theft, trade secret misappropriation, and copyright management information integrity.
- Prosecutions: Targeting distribution groups, individual traders, and pre-release movie distributors. High conviction rate, with most defendants pleading guilty. Average jail time is two years.
- Policy Concerns: Overstating the impact of warez trading on piracy, counterproductive motivational effects, and broad applicability of the law to Americans' daily activities.
- Prediction: Warez traders may become a "sacrificial lamb" for the Department of Justice to satisfy Congress's demand for prosecutions while avoiding public backlash from targeting average Americans.
