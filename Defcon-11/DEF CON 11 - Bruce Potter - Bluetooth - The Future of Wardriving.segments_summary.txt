- Introduction: Bruce Potter begins by introducing himself and his co-worker, Brian Caswell, who is unable to attend the DefCon conference. Potter encourages the audience to question and challenge the information presented at DefCon. He then provides some background information about himself and his work in the field of security.
- Bluetooth vs. 802.11: Potter clarifies that Bluetooth and 802.11 (Wi-Fi) are not related technologies, despite operating in the same 2.4 GHz frequency band. He explains that Bluetooth is a personal area network (PAN) designed for short-range wireless connections, while 802.11 is a local area network (LAN) technology. Potter also mentions the increasing prevalence of Bluetooth-enabled devices and predicts that Bluetooth radios will outnumber 802.11 radios in the future.
- Bluetooth Basics: Potter provides an overview of Bluetooth technology, including its master-slave architecture, frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) modulation, and service discovery. He also mentions the Linux Bluetooth stack, BlueZ, as a recommended resource for those interested in Bluetooth development.
- Bluetooth Security: Potter discusses the pairing process in Bluetooth, which involves creating a trust relationship between devices using a PIN. He highlights the vulnerabilities in the pairing process and the potential for interception and decryption of data. He also mentions the optional nature of authentication and encryption in Bluetooth, which can lead to security risks if not properly configured.
- Device Discovery: Potter explains the challenges of discovering Bluetooth devices, especially those that are not in discoverable mode. He compares it to 802.11 wardriving, where devices are easier to find due to fixed channels and beaconing. He also mentions the importance of service discovery at the application layer and the potential for tracking individuals through their Bluetooth-enabled devices.
- Attacks and Vulnerabilities: Potter discusses various attacks and vulnerabilities in Bluetooth devices, including default settings that leave devices unsecured, and the potential for malware attacks similar to those seen in early 802.11 networks. He also mentions the possibility of intercepting and decrypting data during the pairing process if the PIN is weak.
- Tools and Future Work: Potter introduces "Red Fang," a tool developed by AtStake for discovering Bluetooth devices, and "BlueSNF," a front-end tool he created to improve the usability of Red Fang. He also mentions future work, including integration with other Wi-Fi scanning tools, the need for new scanning methods, and the importance of cataloging Bluetooth hardware capabilities to improve security.
- Questions and Answers: Potter answers questions from the audience, including the possibility of forcing a device into discoverable mode, the predictability of the frequency-hopping pattern, and the consequences of losing a pairing key. He also mentions the existence of other Bluetooth specifications and resources for further reading.
