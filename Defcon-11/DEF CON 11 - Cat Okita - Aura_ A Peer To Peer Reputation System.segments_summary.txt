- Introduction: ORA, a peer-to-peer reputation system software, is introduced, highlighting its decentralized nature and addressing existing systems like Live Journal, Friendster, eBay, and Advogato.
- Reputation Systems: These systems describe social networks through a computer, allowing users to gauge trust, credibility, and establish social connections.
- Challenges: Building a secure and trustworthy reputation system involves authentication, non-repudiation, and trust establishment. Attacks, flooding, trojans, identity theft, and denial of service are potential issues.
- Design Considerations: Emphasis on fast, efficient, secure, portable, and simple code. SQL Light is used for its small size and compatibility.
- Reputation Components: Unique entity identification, personal reputation, general reputation, and specific area reputation (template system) are the key components. Gossip is also included for exchanging information about unknown entities.
- Configuration and Future Plans: Text-based configuration, public-private key cryptography, cross-platform portability, social network analysis, and automation triggers are discussed. The software will be released with a demonstration application.
- Questions and Answers: Answering queries about the software's architecture, file transfer, anonymity, spam filtering, similar applications, reputation propagation, identity revocation, conspiracies, footprint size, and potential applications.
