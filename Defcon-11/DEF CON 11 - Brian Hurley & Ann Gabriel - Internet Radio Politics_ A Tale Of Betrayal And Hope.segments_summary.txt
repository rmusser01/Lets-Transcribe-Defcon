- **Topic:** ASCAP, BMI, and CSEC fees for internet radio stations

- ASCAP, BMI, and CSEC fees for internet radio stations can range from 3% to 5% of revenue, while CARP rates are 100-200%, which is unaffordable for small stations.
- The high fees are regressive, affecting small and large stations but disproportionately impacting smaller ones.
- The RIAA enforces the collection of internet radio royalties and requires stations to register and provide record-keeping information.
- The minimum annual fee for internet broadcasters is $2,000, even for hobbyists or those playing mostly independent music.

- **Topic:** Civil disobedience and legal challenges

- Webcaster Alliance is encouraging its members to refuse to pay the RIAA fees and is planning a lawsuit to challenge the fees and related laws.
- They argue that the fees and restrictions are designed to control content and distribution on the internet, favoring major record labels over independent artists.
- They also plan to challenge the DMCA's definition of internet radio as a copying process rather than a transmission.
- Other potential legal arguments include First and Fifth Amendment issues, antitrust violations, and the quality of digital copies.

- **Topic:** Lobbying and political influence

- The Webcaster Alliance is critical of the influence of the RIAA on legislators, particularly Chairman Sensenbrenner and Senator Orrin Hatch.
- They encourage listeners and webcasters to contact their representatives and support an ethics investigation into Chairman Sensenbrenner.
- They also suggest targeting record companies directly with campaigns and boycotts.
- The organization has received support and evidence from individuals willing to testify against the RIAA and its practices.

- **Topic:** Working with other organizations

- The Webcaster Alliance is working with other organizations, but some are reluctant to publicly support them due to fears of losing their ability to testify before Congress.
- They are also considering working with moveon.org and other similar groups.

- **Topic:** Technology and formats

- The Webcaster Alliance does not advocate for any particular streaming technology or format, but individuals express preferences for Java and MP3.
- They note that while MP3 is not royalty-free, the cost is currently borne by manufacturers and could shift to users in the future.
