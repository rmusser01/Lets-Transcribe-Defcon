- Introduction: The panel includes technology and security experts, as well as former Napster employees, who will discuss the impact and legacy of Napster, a pioneering peer-to-peer file-sharing platform for music.

- Napster's Demise: Internal board conflicts and lawsuits, rather than legal battles with the RIAA, were the main reasons for Napster's downfall. The company was doing well in the courts and had a significant user base, with 90 million users at its peak.

- Music Industry Statistics: Broadband adoption and music streaming are on the rise. Napster outperformed AOL in user enrollment, and the music industry generates $46 billion annually. However, artists may not receive a significant portion of this revenue.

- Intellectual Property and Copyright: The evolution of music distribution is discussed, including the shift from sheet music to digital rights. The panel criticizes the recording industry's response to the platform shift from CDs to digital media, and highlights the issue of artists becoming "work for hire."

- Peer-to-Peer Technology: The panel explores the architecture of peer-to-peer networks and their advantages, such as improved scalability and anonymity. They mention alternatives to Napster like Nutella, Freenet, and wireless municipal networks, which offer enhanced security and privacy.

- File Sharing and Human Behavior: Copyright laws need to adapt to reflect human behavior. File-sharing technology empowers individuals to copy and distribute music, and the demographics of file sharers suggest they will have political influence in the future.

- Live Hives and Smart Mobs: The panel introduces the concept of live hives and smart mobs, where individuals use wireless technology and PDAs to organize and communicate during political demonstrations. This technology enhances the speed and distribution of information, reducing dependence on traditional news sources.
