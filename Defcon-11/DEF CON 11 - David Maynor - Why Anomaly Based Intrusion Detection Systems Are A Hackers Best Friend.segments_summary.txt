- Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): These systems detect unusual activity on a network by establishing a baseline of normal behavior and flagging deviations. They complement signature-based IDS, which look for specific attack patterns or signatures.
- History and Purpose: IDS evolved from the need to detect zero-day attacks that signature-based systems might miss. Anomaly-based IDS aim to identify unusual behavior that could indicate an attack.
- Functionality: Anomaly-based IDS gather data during a tuning phase to establish a network baseline. They then monitor for deviations, such as new ports or applications, to identify potential attacks.
- Challenges: These systems assume that unusual traffic is malicious, which may not always be true. They also require significant hardware resources and are challenging to implement on growing networks.
- Attack Strategies: Attackers can exploit the system's assumptions by crafting packets that appear normal but contain malicious data. Flooding attacks can overwhelm the system, and covert channels can hide malicious data in plain sight.
- Limitations: Anomaly-based IDS struggle with custom applications and common services like web servers. They also have difficulty distinguishing between legitimate and malicious traffic on open services.
- Correlation and Improvement: Combining anomaly-based and signature-based IDS improves security. Anomaly-based IDS are effective against worms and spammers but less so against dedicated attackers. Better correlation between systems and data sources is needed.
- Real-world Experience: The speaker shares their experience with various IDS, favoring a combination of TCP dump and Perl scripts for network monitoring.
