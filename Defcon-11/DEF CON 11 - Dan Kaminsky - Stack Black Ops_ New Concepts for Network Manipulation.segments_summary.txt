- Introduction: The speaker, Dan Kaminsky, starts by mentioning the freedom of speech at DefCon compared to Black Hat, and introduces himself as a security researcher who likes to "fuck with people's heads." He acknowledges his employer, Avaya, and emphasizes his intention to share practical tools and techniques rather than just theories.
- ActiveX Exploit: Kaminsky reveals an ActiveX vulnerability that allows execution of arbitrary code by simply visiting a webpage. He demonstrates how to package any Windows application into a cabinet (CAB) file, sign it with a self-generated certificate, and host it on a web page for easy deployment.
- IP Address Acquisition: Kaminsky discusses the challenges of obtaining an IP address in environments without a DHCP server. He presents techniques such as router detection, NAT migration, and ARP spoofing to acquire or steal IP addresses from routers or other hosts on the network.
- LinkCat and ScanRand: Kaminsky introduces LinkCat, a tool for capturing and manipulating network packets. He demonstrates how to use LinkCat for tasks like string extraction, ping spoofing, and scanning for open ports using ScanRand, a stateless TCP port scanner.
- TTL-based Analysis: Kaminsky explains how Time-to-Live (TTL) values in IP packets can be used to estimate the distance between hosts and detect network anomalies. He showcases examples of detecting email hijacking, multi-homed nodes, and firewall bypasses using TTL analysis with ScanRand.
- OS Fingerprinting: Kaminsky proposes a strategy for OS fingerprinting by sending out batches of packets to identify hosts and analyzing the replies. He emphasizes the importance of integrating data across multiple packets to gain insights into the operating system and network behavior.
- TCP Load Balancing: Kaminsky presents a novel approach to load balancing using TCP redirection. He explains how a redirector can forward packets to anonymous servers, which then spoof the redirector's IP address when replying to the client. This allows for global load distribution and measurement of traffic without direct observation.
- SSL and IDS: Kaminsky discusses the conflict between SSL encryption and IDS monitoring. He proposes a solution where the session key is shared with the IDS, allowing it to decrypt and analyze encrypted traffic. Alternatively, he suggests using HTTP rewriting to send data to the IDS for analysis before passing it to the application.
- Q&A: Kaminsky answers questions from the audience, addressing concerns about ARP conflicts, egress filtering, IP redirection, and static ARP tables. He emphasizes the practicality and effectiveness of the techniques presented and encourages further exploration and improvement.
- Story: Kaminsky concludes with a story from the previous year's DefCon, where a speaker offered a t-shirt to an audience member who checked their email during a talk on email password sniffing, illustrating the importance of secure practices.
