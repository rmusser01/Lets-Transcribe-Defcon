- Kernel Auditing: The presenter conducted a manual audit of open-source kernels (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Linux) to identify security vulnerabilities. The audit focused on simple classes of bugs and common entry points, such as system calls, device drivers, and buffer copies.
- Bug Discovery: The audit revealed a significant number of bugs, including input validation issues, integer overflows, and buffer overflows. These bugs were often found in device driver code and were shared across different platforms. The presenter highlights the contradiction between the perceived complexity of kernel bugs and the simplicity of the discovered vulnerabilities.
- Vendor Response: The presenter shares their experience reporting the bugs to the respective open-source communities. Overall, the response was positive, with vendors such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD addressing the reported issues. However, the presenter notes that some bugs remain unpatched, even after public disclosure.
- Exploitation Techniques: The presenter discusses the potential impact of kernel vulnerabilities, including arbitrary code execution and information disclosure. They highlight the importance of exploiting bugs to gain privileged access, escape sandboxes, and circumvent digital rights management.
- Kernel Exploitation Challenges: The presenter acknowledges the challenges of exploiting kernel vulnerabilities due to the complexity and diversity of kernel implementations. They emphasize the need to target specific implementations and attack the language or implementation rather than algorithms.
- Future Directions: The presenter concludes by emphasizing the ongoing nature of security audits and the presence of unpatched vulnerabilities. They encourage further research and collaboration within the security community to enhance kernel security.
