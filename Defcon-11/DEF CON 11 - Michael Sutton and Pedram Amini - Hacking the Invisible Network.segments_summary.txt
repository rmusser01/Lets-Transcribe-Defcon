- Wireless ISPs (WISPs) and hotspots are becoming increasingly popular, especially in places that target business travelers, such as airports and hotels, as well as cafes.
- WISPs are often implemented cheaply and are vulnerable to various security risks, including revenue loss, network-level attacks, and denial-of-service attacks.
- End users of these networks are also at risk due to a lack of node-level security and end-user awareness.
- Attack scenarios include tunneling data through unfiltered protocols, connection hijacking, and connection sharing.
- Countermeasures for end users include treating the network as untrusted, using VPNs, OS hardening, and node-level firewalls/IDSs.
- Providers of hotspots should use non-internet addressable IP addresses, filter all protocols, and consider implementing IDS/IPS systems.
