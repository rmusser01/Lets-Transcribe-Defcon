- Introduction: Matt Shannon from KPMG discusses Microsoft FrontPage, a web development tool with basic to advanced functionality. He will cover the protocol, backend systems, authentication, ASP, and security.
- Microsoft FrontPage: Created by Vermeer Technologies in 1995, bought by Microsoft in 1996. It is an integrated website development tool with basic to advanced features, part of the Microsoft Office package.
- Decoding the System: FrontPage client-server communication uses HTTP put requests to interact with various Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) and functions. Authentication occurs repeatedly during different actions. FrontPage uses NTLM authentication, and the process is explained in detail.
- VTI_INF: This file provides configuration information, including server version and locations of admin and author DLLs. It also reveals information about the operating system and can be used to determine OS version for further attacks.
- Debugging: Microsoft's WindDbg tool can be used to attach to the I-net info process and debug FrontPage server extensions. This can reveal interesting functions and potential vulnerabilities.
- FP Exploiter: A tool created by the speaker to locate FrontPage-accessible web servers and test for vulnerabilities. It uses default and user-defined accounts and passwords to scan for weak spots.
- ASP for Hackers: Active Server Pages (ASP) provide many options for exploitation. SQL Ultimate, a tool by Michael Brinkley, allows for administrative control of SQL server databases through a web browser.
- Command ASP: A tool that enables execution of simple commands on the command line within ASP. It can be used for tasks like reverse DNS lookup, viewing drive mappings and groups, and pinging internal servers.
- Scanning and Proxy Serving: ASP code can be used with Winsock controls to scan internal networks and proxy serve the intranet, providing access to resources not directly connected to the web server.
- Securing FrontPage: Best practices include strong passwords, changing admin accounts, using front page roles to assign permissions, and restricting access to internal IP addresses or specific network segments.
- Credits and Q&A: The speaker thanks various individuals and resources that contributed to the presentation. Questions from the audience focus on authentication, vulnerabilities, and standard practices for securing FrontPage installations.
