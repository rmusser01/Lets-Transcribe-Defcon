- Hacking the Matrix: The speaker discusses vulnerabilities in a product called "The Matrix," a switch-router made by Interiors (formerly Cable-chon). They highlight how easily an attacker can hijack the connection by completing 10 TCP handshakes to any management service (e.g., Telnet or SSH). They also mention issues with OSPF implementation, which can be exploited to disrupt the entire network.
- GSM and GPRS Basics: The speaker provides an overview of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). They explain the difference between the terminal equipment (phone) and the SIM card, with the latter being crucial for authentication and caller ID. GPRS, a packet-based service, introduces IPV4 into the backbone infrastructure, changing the authentication process.
- GPRS Attack Points: The speaker focuses on vulnerabilities in the GPRS system. They mention the vulnerability found by At Stake in a Nokia GPS box and emphasize the lack of authentication in the GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP), which controls various functions in the network. They also discuss the potential for APN (Access Point Name) filet and weak passwords in authentication servers.
- Exploiting Mobile Phones: The speaker targets the Siemens S55 smartphone, highlighting issues with Bluetooth implementation and file management. They demonstrate how to crash the phone using Java applications and discuss the potential for extracting sensitive information (e.g., missed calls, IMEI) via Java code. They also mention vulnerabilities related to MMS and animated GIF files.
- Cisco IOS Bugs and Exploits: The speaker addresses recent bugs in Cisco IOS, including the UDP Echo Service bug and the HTTP service integer overflow. They provide a detailed explanation of how to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain remote access to Cisco routers. This includes techniques for reliable iOS fingerprinting, runtime iOS patching, and image-independent shell code.
- Defending Mobile Phones and Cisco IOS: The speaker offers recommendations for defending against the discussed attacks. For mobile phones, they suggest turning off Bluetooth and infrared, avoiding Java code, deleting received files, and keeping firmware up to date. For Cisco IOS, they emphasize the importance of disabling unneeded services, protecting infrastructure, updating iOS, and blocking direct communication to routers from external sources.
