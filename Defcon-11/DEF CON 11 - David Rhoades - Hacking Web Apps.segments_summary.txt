- **Web Application Security**: Websites and web applications are vulnerable to hacking, which can lead to defacement, data breaches, and exploitation.
- **Tools for Auditing Web Security**: Tools like Achilles, Web Proxy, IE Booster, and Brutus can intercept, manipulate, and automate web traffic to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Authentication Vulnerabilities**: Brute-force attacks can guess weak passwords, while username and password harvesting can collect valid credentials. Session tracking can be predicted, brute-forced, or stolen via cross-site scripting.
- **Input Validation**: Unexpected user input, such as SQL injection, can exploit application vulnerabilities. Manipulating cookies can also lead to command injection and unauthorized access.
- **Application Logic Flaws**: Performing steps in the wrong order during transactions, such as checking balances before authorization, can allow attackers to extract sensitive information.
- **Conclusion**: No single tool covers all aspects of web application security. A combination of tools, knowledge, and manual testing is required for effective security assessments.
