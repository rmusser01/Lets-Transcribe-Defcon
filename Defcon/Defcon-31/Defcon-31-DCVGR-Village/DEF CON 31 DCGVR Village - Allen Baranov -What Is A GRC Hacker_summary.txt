- Characteristics: creativity, respect for rules, attention to detail, ability to hyperfocus, and lateral thinking
- Organizations can attract neurodiverse hackers by improving job descriptions, interviews, performance reviews, and flexibility
- Neurodiversity can be a strength and a weakness, e.g. creativity, respect for rules, attention to detail, hyperfocus, and lateral thinking can be both beneficial and detrimental depending on the context

**GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)**
- GRC is often seen as the least exciting part of information security
- GRC hackers can use their creativity, attention to detail, and technical knowledge to benefit organizations
- GRC involves managing governance, defining and assessing risks, and ensuring compliance with standards

**Examples of Creative GRC Initiatives**

- April Fool's Day project: sending fake emails to test user behavior and raising awareness
- Physical penetration testing: partnering with external organizations to assess security

**Conclusion**
- Hackers should embrace their unique perspectives and skills, regardless of their specific domain (offensive security or GRC)
- Being a hacker is a way of life, combining technical expertise with creativity, curiosity, and a drive for community
