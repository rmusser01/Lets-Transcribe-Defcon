**Introduction**:
- Talk by **Hoodie Pony**, a cyber security expert from Melbourne, Australia.
- Focuses on **off-the-wire command and control**, demonstrating creative approaches for attackers and defenders.

**The Challenge**:
- Traditional **network-based command and control** is becoming more difficult due to improved detection and response mechanisms.
- Need to find alternative methods that are less detectable.

**Live Demo**:
- Presented a **proof-of-concept (POC)** using a **Parallels VM** with the network and Bluetooth disconnected.
- Demonstrated controlling the VM without physical access, highlighting the potential for wireless command and control.

**Guessing Game**:
- Encouraged audience to guess the wireless protocol used in the POC.
- Eliminated options: **Cellular**, **Bluetooth**, **Wi-Fi**, **Ultrasonics**, **Infrared**.
- Hint: Protocol is not in the **Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM)** radio spectrum.

**Solution**:
- Protocol used was **APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System)**, a digital communications protocol for exchanging information.
- Initially developed by **Brock Bruninger** at the U.S. Naval Academy, used for technical messaging and position tracking.
- Operates on **2 meters in the U.S. (144.39 MHz)** and **145.175 MHz in Australia**.
- **Not widely monitored or defended**, making it a viable option for covert communication.

**Implementation Details**:
- Requires an **amateur radio license** to transmit, following local regulations.
- Suggested tools: **RTL-SDR**, **TX-capable radio**, **Linux-based computer**, **APRS Droid app**, and custom **C2 program**.
- Configuration details provided for setting up the system and executing commands.

**Alternative Methods**:
- Suggested using an **overlay network like Tailscale or ZeroTier** to handle changing IP addresses in 4G/5G networks.
- Integrating with organization's authentication and authorization systems for controlled access.
- Using a **Raspberry Pi with a 4G/5G hat** for flexibility and additional capabilities.

**Defenses**:
- **Defense in depth** is crucial, including network segmentation, mutual TLS, physical network separation, and air gaps.
- Mature organizations should implement controls like **VLANs**, **NACs**, **MAC address allow lists**, and **802.1X**.
- RF-specific defenses are costly but effective, such as minimizing RF emissions and implementing TEMPEST standards or SCIFs.

**Conclusion**:
- Highlighted the importance of exploring alternative communication methods for both attackers and defenders.
- Encouraged attendees to pursue amateur radio licenses and explore the potential of RF-based communications.
