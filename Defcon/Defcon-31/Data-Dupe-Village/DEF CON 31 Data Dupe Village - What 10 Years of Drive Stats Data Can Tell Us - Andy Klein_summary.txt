**Introduction**
- Speaker: Andy Klein
- Topic: Hard Drive and SSD Failure Data and Statistics

**Data Collection and Analysis**
- **Monitoring**: Approximately 250,000 hard drives and 3 exabytes of data.
- **Data Collection Tool**: SmartMARS, which records **SMART** (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) statistics.
- **Data Frequency**: Daily snapshots of SMART statistics from each drive.
- **Data Analysis**: Tracking drive behavior, temperature, media health, and failure prediction.
- **Open-Source Data**: Available for public access and analysis.

**Failure Definition and Calculation**
- **Reactive Failure**: Drive stops functioning and cannot be accessed.
- **Proactive Failure**: ATA errors, failed file system checks, or abnormal SMART statistics indicate impending failure.
- **Annualized Failure Rate (AFR)**: Calculated using drive days (number of drives x days in operation) and failures within a specific period.
- **Drive Cohort**: Analysis based on active drive models as of Q2 2023.
- **Confidence Interval**: Statistical measure to determine the reliability of the AFR; a difference of 0.5 or less indicates a solid AFR.

**Drive Statistics and Reports**
- **Reports**: Quarterly, annual, and lifetime reports published with AFR and confidence interval for various drive models.
- **Gold Medal Winners**: List of recommended drives based on AFR and confidence interval.
- **Drive Model Numbers**: Minor changes in model numbers can indicate significant differences; always refer to specific models when considering purchase decisions.
- **SSDs vs. HDDs**: Analysis of boot drive failures over time suggests SSDs have lower failure rates than HDDs.

**SMART Statistics for SSDs**
- **Common SMART Stats**: Power on hours, power cycle count, temperature, SSD wear leveling, and unexpected power loss.
- **Vendor-Specific Stats**: Seagate, WDC, and Crucial use different SMART stats for lifetime percentage, drive life protection status, endurance remaining, and storage without power.
- **Crucial RAIN Feature**: Redundancy through data hashing and invisible parity for data recovery.
- **SSD Storage Without Power**: Recommended maximum storage period is one year, depending on usage and vendor-specific SMART stats.

**Hard Drive Fun Facts**
- **Average Failed Drive Age**: Analysis of failed drives suggests an average age of around two years and six to seven months.
- **Failure Rates by Drive Size and Manufacturer**: Published data includes failure rates by drive size and manufacturer, with Seagate having higher failure rates but other factors also considered in procurement decisions.
- **Cost Analysis**: Model for cost comparison between drive models based on failure rates, replacement costs, and procurement factors.
- **Data Center Factors**: Future analysis will include failure rates by data center location, server type, and temperature, including water-cooled data centers.

**Q&A**
- **Home Backup Drive**: Seagate 6TB HDD.
- **SSD Data Storage**: Based on power applied to the chip, not the bit being written to.
- **Vibration Influence**: Difficult to measure, but anecdotally, it can impact drive health and neighboring drives.
- **Human Element**: Maintenance records may indicate potential correlations between personnel and drive failures.
