**Introduction**
- DEF CON 31 policy panel discussion on cybercrime prevention and IoT security.
- Speakers: Kat Megas (NIST) and Peter Stevens (OECD, formerly UK government).

**IoT Security Landscape**
- Mirai botnet in 2017 highlighted the need for improved IoT security.
- **White House Executive Order 13800**: directed DoC and DHS to address botnets and DDoS attacks, with a focus on IoT device security.
- **IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act (2020)**: mandates federal agencies to procure IoT devices complying with NIST guidelines.
- **State Legislation**: Oregon and California enacted laws requiring minimum cybersecurity standards for IoT devices sold within their states.
- **NDAA (2021)**: directed DoC to establish an IoT Federal Working Group and a public group for stakeholder engagement.
- **Executive Order 14028**: directed NIST to develop minimum cybersecurity criteria and labeling for consumer IoT products.
- **US National Cybersecurity Strategy**: emphasizes the importance of IoT security.

**NIST's Role in IoT Security**
- NIST published technical and non-technical **baseline cybersecurity requirements** for IoT devices.
- Technical requirements include authentication, data protection, etc.
- Non-technical requirements include vulnerability disclosure processes, secure software development practices, supply chain risk management, etc.
- Emphasis on risk assessment and recognizing that risk depends on device context and use case.
- **Labeling Program**: piloted a voluntary labeling program for consumer IoT products, with consistent design and binary security assessment.
- **Consumer Education**: emphasized the role of consumers in securing IoT products, while also recognizing the need for flexibility due to varying use cases.
- **Liability Considerations**: addressed concerns by recommending liability protections for manufacturers participating in the voluntary labeling program.
- **Standards and International Considerations**: encouraged the use of existing standards and mutual recognition of certification schemes across countries.
- **Self-Attestation and Third-Party Certification**: recommended a combination of self-attestation and third-party certification to support innovation and provide flexibility.

**UK's Secure by Design Initiative**
- Aims to improve IoT security by codifying good practices, building partnerships, and engaging with security researchers and other governments.
- Published the **Code of Practice** with 13 outcome-focused general principles to prevent incidents like Mirai.
- Translated the Code into multiple languages to reach a wider audience.
- Supported the development of international standards, such as ETSI's work on IoT security.
- Recognized the importance of **mapping multiple standards** to demonstrate consensus and provide a common language for assurance schemes and legislation.
- Conducted a **consultation** in 2019, receiving near-universal support for legislation and mixed feedback on a consumer labeling scheme.
- **Legislative Approach**: introduced the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act, which received royal assent in December 2022.
- The Act provides a framework for defining minimum security requirements for IoT devices, enforced through regulations.
- **Regulations** introduced in 2023 include: no default passwords, coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and clear information on security update support.
- These regulations will become law in April 2024, with enforcement and fines for non-compliance.

**Discussion on Interoperability and Alignment**
- Producers of IoT products face challenges due to varying requirements across different countries.
- The desire for **alignment** among countries needs to be balanced with the reality of different regulatory approaches and manufacturing bases.
- Emphasis on **interoperability** by focusing on common expectations and implementation differences rather than conflicting requirements.
- The **Connectivity Standards Alliance** is working on a comprehensive specification that aligns with multiple countries' requirements, enabling interoperability.
- Collaboration and information sharing between countries, like the US and UK, are crucial for effective IoT security policies and regulations.
