**Introduction**
- **Will Loomis**: Goon at DEF CON, introducing the talk and panelists

**Panelists**
- **Nina Collers**: Moderator, Associate Professor at the Cyber and Innovation Policy Institute, US Naval War College
- **Josh Reiter**: Deputy PCA, Department of the Navy, former Merchant Marine Officer and IT Manager for the Port of Austin
- **Blake Benson**: Industrial Control System and Cybersecurity Practice Lead at ABS, former cyber operator in the Air Force
- **Cliff Nieve**: Director for MAD Maritime at MAD Security, retired Coast Guard officer, former Deputy Commander at Coast Guard Cyber Command

**Discussion Topics**
- **Why Should We Care About Maritime Cyber Policy?**: The maritime domain is critical to the global economy, with 90% of consumer goods transported by sea. Disruptions or attacks on this sector can have far-reaching consequences, affecting supply chains, prices, and the availability of goods.
- **Scenarios and Concerns**: The lack of clear governance and standardized cyber security practices in the maritime industry is concerning. The potential for cyber incidents to disrupt port operations, impact critical functions, and have widespread economic impacts keeps the panelists up at night.
- **Challenges and Leadership**: The maritime industry struggles with a lack of coherent strategy and leadership when it comes to cyber security. Articulating cyber risk, integrating cyber with overall business plans, and allocating resources effectively are significant challenges.
- **Successes and Promising Approaches**: CISA's central role in cyber incident reporting and coordination, the Coast Guard's cyber specialists in sectors and districts, and the development of workforce training standards are positive steps. Emphasizing performance-based standards and incentivizing cyber security investments are also promising approaches.
- **Vulnerability Disclosure**: There is a need for a clear front door and designated points of contact for vulnerability reporting to improve coordination and response.
- **Incentivizing Cyber Security**: Industry often treats cyber security as a checkbox, and there is a lack of incentive to invest in cyber beyond compliance. Suggestions include performance-based standards and weighting cyber security posture in contract evaluations.
- **International Collaboration**: While international collaboration in maritime cyber security is challenging due to competition and differing priorities, it is important to consider the impact of regulations on all ships calling on the US, not just US shipping.

**Conclusion**
- The panel concludes with a Q&A session, emphasizing the ongoing challenges and opportunities in maritime cyber policy and cyber security practices.
