**Introduction**
- Adrian, Chief Operations of the Syopis Institute, a non-profit based in Geneva, Switzerland, is moderating the session.
- The session will discuss how **hackers** can help protect **high-risk communities** by working with the **government**, **industry**, **academia**, and **civil society**.

**Session Structure**
- Half-hour of introductions from each panelist (5 minutes each).
- Break into three small groups for in-depth discussions:
    - How **hackers** can help the **government**.
    - How **hackers** can help **industry**.
    - How **hackers** can help **academia** and **civil society**.
- Regroup to share insights and contributions.

**David from CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency)**
- CISA has launched a **High-Risk Communities Protection Planning Effort** to improve **cybersecurity** for **high-risk communities**.
- **High-risk communities** refer to **civil society**, including **journalists**, **human rights organizations**, and **NGOs**, which are frequent targets of **APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)** actors.
- Three goals of the initiative:
    - Raise the **cyber hygiene baseline** for civil society.
    - Improve the **resilience** of organizations that have been targeted.
    - Increase **government** and **industry support** for civil society through real commitments.
- CISA has established three **working groups** with over 30 industry and civil society partners to address specific areas:
    - **Cyber Threat Intelligence**: Creating useful **CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence)** for individuals and small NGOs, and improving information sharing.
    - **Awareness and Accessibility**: Launching a dedicated website in October (**Cybersecurity Month**) with cyber trainings, vulnerability assessments, and a database of **cyber volunteer organizations**.
    - **Operational Collaboration and Best Practices**: Enhancing collaboration between large companies (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Apple) and civil society organizations for better threat notifications and sustained communications.

**Maurice from USAID (United States Agency for International Development)**
- USAID is an independent government agency that manages most of the foreign assistance budget and works in over 70 countries.
- USAID's programs have digital components and generate data, making them vulnerable to cyber threats.
- USAID supports **high-risk communities** and civil society organizations through various programs:
    - **Greater Internet Freedom Program**: Provides resources for independent networks of hackers and digital security consultants in 30+ countries.
    - **Digital Apex**: Hires security companies and hackers to provide training and assessments in countries where USAID works.
    - **Country-specific programs**: Focus on resilience-building for civil society and at-risk communities.
- USAID is excited to collaborate with CISA's High-Risk Community Program and engage with the hacker community to enhance cyber resilience for high-risk communities.

**Monica from Microsoft**
- Microsoft shares information with customers and users through the **Microsoft Digital Defense Report** and regional reports by the **Microsoft Threat Analysis Center**.
- Microsoft employees volunteer for the **Cyber Peace Institute**, particularly the **Cyber Peace Builders** program, which provides cyber support to critical sector NGOs.
- Microsoft offers free tools and trainings for high-risk communities, such as **Account Guard**, which provides advanced protection and notifications, and a catalog of cyber trainings for civil society organizations.
- Microsoft is also addressing the talent pipeline issue through the **Microsoft Skilling Initiative**, aiming to bring 250,000 people into the cybersecurity field by 2025 and expanding the program internationally.

**Mark from McDermott, Will & Emery**
- McDermott, Will & Emery conducted a study on **cyber volunteering**, published in March 2022, to understand the gap between the dearth of cybersecurity professionals and the need for cyber support in smaller organizations.
- The study made several recommendations, some of which are being adopted by CISA's working groups.
- The report can be found at the link provided.

**Sarah from UC Berkeley**
- Sarah is the program director of **Public Interest Cybersecurity** at the **Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity** at UC Berkeley.
- Academia is becoming a significant player in providing cyber services to under-resourced organizations through **cybersecurity clinics**.
- Cybersecurity clinics are based on the concept that you **don't need to be an expert to be of service**. Students from various degree programs are trained in basic cybersecurity and then paired with real clients in their communities.
- Examples of clinics:
    - UC Berkeley: Focuses on civil society organizations at risk of politically motivated cyber attacks, both domestically and internationally.
    - University of Georgia: Serves school districts and local businesses in Georgia.
    - University of Nevada, Las Vegas: Partners with the small business council to help local businesses with cyber hygiene.

**Adrian from the Cyber Peace Institute**
- The Cyber Peace Institute is a non-profit based in Geneva with a mission to bring about **cyber peace**.
- Three core activities:
    - Provide assistance to vulnerable communities.
    - Document how those communities suffer due to cyber attacks.
    - Engage with public and private stakeholders to develop better laws and regulations for protection.
- The **Cyber Peace Builders** program complements the work of cybersecurity clinics by providing a platform for corporate cybersecurity professionals to volunteer their skills and help vulnerable communities.
- Key considerations for the program:
    - **Trust**: Vetting and assessing volunteers at scale by working with reputable companies.
    - **Availability of Talent**: Tapping into the largest pool of cyber talent in the corporate sector.
    - **Financial Sustainability**: Leveraging CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) budgets and introducing a financial pipeline through non-profit SaaS (Software as a Service) models.
- The Cyber Peace Builders has helped over 150 non-profits worldwide and is looking to scale up further.
