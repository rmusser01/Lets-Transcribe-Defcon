**International Cyber Security Policy**
- Aim: Understanding of key priorities and approaches across countries.

**Challenges for Cyber Security Policy Makers**
- Creating their own identity and translating it into securing existing technologies.
- Learning from experiences to build resilience and address issues more effectively.
- Exploring the future cyber workforce and cybersecurity skills agenda.

**UK's Approach to Secure by Design**
- **Secure by Default**: Ensuring security and data sharing systems are secure, not an add-on.
- Analogies: Seatbelts in cars, circular windows in airplanes.
- **Guidance**: Roadmap for companies to improve security, developed with Australia, US, and other partners.
- **Product Security Act**: Consumer device security, no default passwords, vulnerability reporting, and transparency on update periods.
- **Telecoms Security Act**: Recognizing telecoms and networks as the backbone of daily life, raising resilience, and addressing vulnerable areas.

**Australia's Critical Infrastructure Protection**
- **2017**: Legislation introduced to address deteriorated geostrategic environment, prohibiting vendor equipment from countries subject to extraterritorial direction.
- **Critical Infrastructure Assets**: Defined 11 sectors and 22 asset classes, with mandatory reporting of asset holdings, ownership, and cyber incidents.
- **Risk Management Plans**: Required to use internationally recognized frameworks (e.g., NIST) and develop incident response plans with the Australian Cyber Security Centre.
- **Systems of National Significance**: 82 assets designated for enhanced protection, with potential for government intervention in extreme cases.

**European Union's Cyber Resilience Act**
- **Ecosystem Approach**: Addressing the complex interplay of devices, services, data, software, and real-world impacts.
- **Risk-Based Classification**: Class 1 (lower risk) and Class 2 (higher risk) products with corresponding conformity assessment requirements.
- **Updates and Patching**: Ensuring security updates are on by default, separating functional updates, and enabling factory resets with security updates.
- **Data Handling**: Ensuring compliance with GDPR and other data protection regulations, addressing confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Role of Standards and International Organizations**
- **Standards**: Bedrock for regulation, business agreements, and other arrangements, but not a tool for direct regulation.
- **Geopolitics**: EU's preference for creating new standards vs. leveraging existing ones, and the role of international organizations like the OECD in providing recommendations.
- **Capacity Building**: Sharing good practices and recommendations to assist countries with limited cyber capacity.

**Latin America and Africa's Cyber Challenges**
- **Latin America**: Countries like Mexico, Brazil, and Chile developing cyber strategies, but lacking implementation expertise. Emphasis on creating dedicated cybersecurity agencies.
- **Costa Rica**: Devastating ransomware attack with lasting impacts, highlighting the need for improved cyber defenses.
- **Africa**: Kenya's recent incident underscoring the region's overall lack of preparedness, with some countries taking initial steps toward building cyber defenses.

**Policy Considerations for the Year Ahead**
- **Australia**: New cyber strategy aligned with US strategy, shifting burden to those best able to manage risk and incentivizing long-term investments.
- **UK**: Emphasizing whole-of-society approach with the tagline, "Make the UK the safest place to live and work online."
- **Emerging Technologies**: AI, quantum, and semiconductors as key focus areas, with security principles embedded from the start.
- **Australia's New Cyber Strategy**: Addressing the maze of unclear regulation, providing clear directives, and improving bi-directional information exchange with industry.

**Skills and Cyber Workforce Development**
- **Australia**: Anticipated shortage of 46,000 cyber professionals by 2026, addressing through curricula changes, professionalism schemes, and return-to-work programs.
- **European Parliament**: Severe skills shortage, especially in cyber security, with unique challenges in attracting talent due to career structure and salary constraints.
- **Contracted Service Providers**: Used as a stopgap solution, but not a long-term fix.
- **UK's Approach**: Creating a clear career path and visualization for cyber professionals, with the Cyber Security Advisory Council as an umbrella organization.
- **Diversity and Apprenticeships**: Emphasized as crucial for expanding the cyber workforce, along with creative approaches to attract diverse talent.

**AI and its Implications**
- **UK's Perspective**: Emphasizing the potential benefits of AI while managing risks, learning from past experiences, and embedding security principles early on.
- **AI Regulation**: DSIT and NCSC providing guidance and principles, with an upcoming global AI summit to build international collaboration.

**Election Security and Integrity**
- **European Parliament**: Facing increased attacks due to its support for Ukraine, focusing on election integrity and foreign interference.
- **Disinformation and Micro-targeting**: Concern over the use of AI-driven systems to spread targeted misinformation and influence elections.
- **Classification of Election Systems**: Call to classify election systems as critical infrastructure, recognizing their vulnerability to cyber attacks.
- **AI's Role in Decision-Making**: Emphasizing the need for transparency and integrity in AI-driven decision-support systems.

**Question and Answer Session**
- **Enforcing Cyber Security Policies on Small Businesses**: Balancing national security and cyber security, providing knowledge transfer, and considering the impact of regulations like GDPR on smaller entities.
- **Optimism in Private Sector Collaboration**: Bug bounties, public-private partnerships, threat sharing, and the need for collaborative innovation and standardized solutions.
