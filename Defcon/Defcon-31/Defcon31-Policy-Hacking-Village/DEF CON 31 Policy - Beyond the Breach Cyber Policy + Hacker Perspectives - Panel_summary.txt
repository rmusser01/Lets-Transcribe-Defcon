**Introduction:**
- **Isabella Ross**: Communications Officer for the Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism (CICTE) of the Organization of American States (OAS).
- **Panelists**: Mauro Vichatti, Orlando Garces, and Andres Velasquez.

**Cybersecurity Policy and Hacker Perspectives:**
- The field of **cybersecurity policy** is constantly evolving, requiring innovative and critical thinking about **policy solutions** to address new and emerging threats.
- The discussion focuses on the **role of cybersecurity policy hackers** in shaping and advancing cybersecurity policies, addressing challenges, and the need for collaboration and innovation.

**Latin America and the Caribbean's Cooperative Environment:**
- **Andres Velasquez**: Latin America and the Caribbean face a challenge of **mistrust** between governments, hackers, and academia, hindering effective collaboration.
- Emphasizes the need to shift paradigms and foster **cooperation** and **trust** to enhance cybersecurity policies.
- Jurisdictional issues and lengthy information-sharing processes between countries pose significant challenges.
- Latin American countries lack clear frameworks for reporting vulnerabilities, often resulting in legal repercussions for ethical hackers.
- The perception of hackers as "the bad guys" needs to be addressed, and educational initiatives can help build understanding and collaboration.

**National Cybersecurity Strategies in the Region:**
- **Orlando Garces**: Over half of OAS member states have formulated national cybersecurity policies or strategies, with varying levels of maturity.
- The OAS CICTE program provides technical and policy-level cybersecurity capacities to ensure an **open, secure, and resilient cyberspace** in the Western Hemisphere.
- Challenges include a **lack of technical understanding** among authorities, a hostile view of hacking, and legal barriers to engaging the hacker community.
- There is a growing involvement of international and regional organizations, as well as the private sector, in cyber policymaking in the region.

**Hacker Perspectives in Global Organizations:**
- **Mauro Vichatti**: Works for the **International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)**, a large humanitarian organization operating in over 100 countries.
- ICRC engages with the hacker community to **digitize its emblem**, signaling protected assets in cyberspace during armed conflicts, and to develop **open-source tools** to ensure independence and protect beneficiary information.
- The ICRC plans to further involve the hacker community in developing tools and identifying venues to preserve neutrality and respect for beneficiary information.

**National Policy Approaches to Ethical Hacking:**
- Orlando Garces outlines three approaches to promoting ethical hacking in Latin America and the Caribbean:
   - **Creating legal frameworks**: Chile is an example, with a law exempting ethical hackers from criminal sanctions under certain conditions.
   - **Incorporating ethical hacking into national cybersecurity strategies**: The Dominican Republic includes responsible vulnerability disclosure as a guiding principle.
   - **Developing national guides for information sharing and responsible disclosure**: While not comprehensive, these guides are a starting point.

**European Examples of Collaboration:**
- Mauro Vichatti shares his experience creating a vulnerability management unit and the first bug bounty program for the Swiss government:
   - Developed a central platform paid by the government, with different cantons paying bounties for testing their assets.
   - Plans to replicate this model for the ICRC and its national societies, engaging the hacker community on a larger scale.

**The Role of Cybersecurity Policy Hackers in Digital Investigations:**
- Andres Velasquez highlights the importance of policy hackers as **frontline defenders** in the fight against cybercrime.
- Challenges include a lack of awareness, limited resources, and standardized cybersecurity policies, as well as legal framework issues.
- Emphasizes the need for collaboration between hackers and governments, building trust and legal frameworks to enable effective digital investigations.

**Addressing Cross-Border Security and Changing Scenarios:**
- Panelists discuss the impact of polarization and changing governments on cybersecurity policies in Latin America.
- The lack of robust governance models and expertise leads to costly changes when governments change.
- OAS focuses on fostering robust governance models and bringing all stakeholders together to create strong national cybersecurity strategies.

**Incentivizing Adoption of International Standards:**
- A question is raised about incentivizing public and private sectors to adopt international standards for information security.
- Orlando Garces responds that OAS encourages member states to engage with such initiatives and brings technical experts to discussions.
- Emphasizes the importance of presenting initiatives effectively to decision-makers and notes that Latin American countries often react to catastrophes rather than proactively adopting standards.

**Conclusion:**
- The discussion highlights the evolving nature of cybersecurity policy and the crucial role of hacker perspectives in shaping effective solutions.
- Collaboration, trust, and legal frameworks are key to harnessing the potential of ethical hacking and addressing cyber threats.
- Standardization of cybersecurity strategies and robust governance models are essential to adapt to changing scenarios and ensure a secure cyberspace.
