## Panel Introduction
- **David Rogers**: Panel moderator and advisor to the UK government on security matters.
- **Camille Stewart-Gloucester**: Deputy National Cyber Director at the Technology and Ecosystem Security Division, White House.
- **Charlie Gladstone**: Head of Software Resilience at the UK Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology.
- **Alan Friedman**: Senior Advisor and Strategist at the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), US.

## Software Resilience: Challenges and Solutions
- **Software Security**: The lifeblood of the digital economy, driving innovation and organizational productivity.
- **Software Risks**: Insecurely developed software remains a significant threat to organizational resilience.
- **Market Incentives**: Security is often a secondary consideration for software vendors and customers, who prioritize functionality and cost.
- **Open-Source Software**: Opacity of incentives for developers to incorporate security, and challenges in peer review and maintenance.
- **Solutions**: Collaboration between governments and industry, international standards, and shifting burden to large players.

## Open-Source Software Security
- **Open-Source Initiatives**: US and UK initiatives to address open-source software security, including the Open Source Software Security Initiative and regulatory harmonization.
- **Memory-Safe Languages**: Transitioning from memory-unsafe languages to memory-safe languages can remediate up to 70% of security vulnerabilities.
- **Liability Structures**: Incentivizing security and discouraging abuse of open-source developers by large tech companies.
- **Peer Review**: Encouraging and protecting security researchers who identify vulnerabilities.

## Procurement and Contracts
- **Contractual Accountability**: Empowering organizations, especially small and medium-sized businesses, to hold software vendors accountable through contracts.
- **Standardized Clauses**: Developing standardized security clauses for contracts to set baseline security expectations.
- **Transparency**: Vendors need to provide information about their security practices and how they securely develop software.
- **Government's Role**: Leading by example as a responsible player in the open-source ecosystem and using purchasing power to drive the market.

## End-of-Life and Legacy Systems
- **End-of-Life Communication**: UK's Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act requires IOT manufacturers to communicate the lifespan and update period for their products.
- **Code Escrow**: A mechanism to access source code in case a company goes bust, but its effectiveness is questionable.
- **Legacy Systems**: Addressing security for legacy systems, especially in critical infrastructure and safety-critical areas.
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Tools like Software Observable Behavior Analytics (SOBA) to understand and monitor software behavior on networks.

## International Standards and Government's Role
- **International Standards**: Globally accepted solutions are preferred over country-specific standards to avoid fragmentation and duplication.
- **Government's Role**: Governments can add authority to standards and encourage their use, but also need to be cautious about premature standardization.
- **Bilateral and Multilateral Engagement**: Engaging with international partners to share lessons learned and drive similar solutions and outcomes.
- **Regulatory Harmonization**: Efforts to minimize regulatory arbitrage and reduce burden on industry, such as the UK's Plan for Digital Regulation.

## Practical Steps for Small Businesses
- **Industry-Led Solutions**: Encouraging industry to create tools and solutions that reduce complexity and make it easier for small businesses to secure themselves.
- **Training and Education**: Providing training and guidance to small businesses, such as the UK's Cyber Aware campaign and CISA's resources for small and medium-sized businesses.
- **Fractional Hiring**: Sharing talent and resources, such as having a cybersecurity resource work for multiple small businesses part-time.
- **Analog Solutions**: Considering backup plans and analog solutions for when digital systems fail, such as paper ballots for elections.

## Final Thoughts and Reflections
- **Catastrophic Attacks**: The lack of a major catastrophic cyber attack despite the increasing number of threats is a concern.
- **Prioritization and Resources**: Governments face the challenge of limited resources and an infinite number of challenges, requiring careful prioritization.
- **Collaboration and Partnership**: True collaboration between governments and the private sector is essential for effective cyber security.
- **Audience Poll**: A majority of the audience felt more confident about government's approach to software resilience after the panel discussion.
