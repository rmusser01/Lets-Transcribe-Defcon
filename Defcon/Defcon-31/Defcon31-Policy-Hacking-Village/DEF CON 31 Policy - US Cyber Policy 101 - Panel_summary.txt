- **US Cyber Policy Overview**:
    - **Critical Infrastructure**:
        - Shift from voluntary risk management to mandatory cyber security regulation.
        - Sectors with new or upcoming regulations: water, rail, pipelines, aviation, financial, chemical, health, and medical devices.
    - **IOT Security**:
        - White House-backed initiative for a trust mark on connected devices, indicating baseline security.
        - FCC's Notice of Proposed Rule Making to implement the concept.
        - Dynamic and layered information, from basic to technical to machine-readable.
        - Possible inclusion of a QR code.
        - Voluntary security standards by NIST as criteria.
        - False advertising liability for misrepresenting security.
    - **Vulnerability Disclosure**:
        - Growing trend of regulations requiring disclosure to government agencies, e.g., EU Cyber Resilience Act, French military programming legislation, and Chinese vulnerability disclosure requirement.
        - Concerns about government agencies' security and potential misuse of disclosed vulnerabilities.
    - **Incident Reporting**:
        - Regulations for critical infrastructure (CERCIA), publicly traded companies (SEC), and other sectors.
        - Emphasis on transparency rather than resilience.
        - **Harmonization** efforts led by the Office of the National Cyber Director:
            - Request for information on regulatory harmonization.
            - Aim to streamline and align cyber security requirements, especially for independent agencies and states.
    - **Artificial Intelligence**:
        - Administration's focus on AI security, e.g., DARPA AI Challenge, generative AI red teaming village.
        - Legislative and state proposals, international strategies, and private sector initiatives.
- **Hacker Law Priorities**:
    - **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)**:
        - Narrowed by Supreme Court and DOJ charging policy, but state laws remain broad.
    - **DMCA Section 1201**:
        - Exceptions for security researchers, but no exception for tool trafficking (making tools publicly available).
    - **CVD and Vulnerability Disclosure Policies**:
        - Positive developments, but concern about mandatory disclosure to governments.
- **Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD)**:
    - Established in 2021 to address cyber security issues across the federal government.
    - **National Cyber Security Strategy**:
        - Two fundamental shifts: shifting the burden to more capable entities and incentivizing long-term cyber security investments.
    - **Implementation Plan**:
        - Released in August 2023 with transparency and accountability in mind.
    - **Recent Initiatives**:
        - Request for information on regulatory harmonization.
        - Open source software and memory safe languages.
        - National cyber workforce and education strategy.
        - Call to action on censorship circumvention tools.
- **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**:
    - Mission: protect and promote public health through regulatory activities, including oversight of medical devices.
    - **Medical Device Cybersecurity**:
        - Initial resistance from manufacturers to security vulnerabilities.
        - FDA's stance: safe devices must be cyber secure.
        - **Guidance and Policies**: pre-market and post-market guidance, coordinated vulnerability disclosure, software bill of materials, and patching policies.
        - **New Authorities**: received additional cybersecurity authorities in the omnibus bill passed in December 2022 (Patch Act).
        - **Refuse to Accept Policy**: submissions without necessary cybersecurity elements will be rejected starting October 1st, 2023.
- **National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS)**:
    - Membership association representing secretaries of state, who are independently elected constitutional officers in almost every state.
    - **Role in Cyber Policy**:
        - Liaison between states and federal government, especially CISA.
        - Information sharing and best practices among members.
    - **Trends and Priorities**:
        - Cyber navigator programs to support local government election administrators.
        - Maturing risk assessment models and cyber incident reporting.
        - Establishing cyber security teams and CISOs within secretary of state offices.
        - Implementing vulnerability disclosure policies and engaging with the hacker community.
- **Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)**:
    - **Mission**: work with partners to drive down systemic risk and defend critical infrastructure.
    - **Strategy and Authorities**: cyber strategic plan, national cyber security plan, and CISA's strategic plan.
    - **Interagency Collaboration**: doers and advisors, executing strategies from ONCD, NSC, and CISA.
    - **Priorities for Next Year**:
        - Increase visibility and mitigate threats through data collaboration and cyber response.
        - Harden the terrain and understand attack vectors.
        - Drive security at scale: Secure by Design, open source software security, emerging tech, and workforce development.
- **Q&A**:
    - Regulatory harmonization in higher education to align research and educational data sectors.
    - Material incident reporting and the role of IR leaders in aligning facts with FOIA-able records.
    - Collaboration between agencies on securing medical devices, election devices, and other IoT devices.
    - Ensuring compliance throughout the supply chain, including subcontractors and vendors.
    - Initiatives to standardize security controls and lower the barrier to entry for companies.
