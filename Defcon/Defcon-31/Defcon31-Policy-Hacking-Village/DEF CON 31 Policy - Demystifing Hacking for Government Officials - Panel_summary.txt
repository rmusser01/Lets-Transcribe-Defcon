**Introduction**
- This is a panel discussion from DEF CON 31, titled "Demystifying Hacking for Government Officials."
- The discussion focuses on collaboration between **hackers** and **policymakers** in the context of **election security** and **cyber resilience**.

**Panelists**
- **Heather** (Room Host)
- **Lindsay Folson** (Deputy Executive Director, National Association of Secretaries of State (NAS))
- **Jack Cable** (Senior Technical Advisor, CISA)
- **Michael Ross** (Deputy Secretary of State and Chief of Staff, Iowa Secretary of State's Office)
- **Jason Ingalls** (Founder and CEO, Ingalls Information Security)
- **Brad Manuel** (Chief Information Officer, Louisiana Secretary of State's Office)

**Background and History**
- The 2016 elections heightened attention to **cyber security** in **election administration**, particularly after the **targeting of voter registration infrastructure** by a **nation-state**.
- In 2017, elections were designated as **critical infrastructure** by the Department of Homeland Security, leading to increased security research attention.
- The initial relationship between the **election community** and the **security research community** was **rocky**, but efforts have been made to build **trust** and **understanding**.

**Bringing DEF CON to NAS**
- Michael Ross, after attending DEF CON, proposed bringing a similar event to NAS to demystify hacking for state government officials and build collaboration.
- The first event, "Hacking Demystified," included activities like **lock picking**, **soldering**, and **IoT hacking**, providing a fun and interactive introduction for NAS members and staff.
- Subsequent events ("Hacking Demystified 2.0" and "Hacking Demystified 3.0") focused on specific themes: **ransomware** and **data breaches**, respectively.

**State Perspectives and Lessons Learned**
- **Iowa** has embraced security research, inviting **white hat hackers** to identify vulnerabilities and reassuring the public about election security.
- **Louisiana** emphasized the importance of **collaborative resilience**, highlighting the value of open communication with third-party vendors, educators, and researchers.
- The need to assist smaller counties with limited IT resources was also discussed, recognizing the challenge of ensuring cyber security across all jurisdictions.

**Encouraging Collaboration**
- It is important to **coordinate directly** with those implementing and overseeing systems, meeting each other where we are and respecting each other's expertise.
- **Disagreement** is inevitable, but collaboration increases the value of the work and builds trust.
- Demystification goes both waysâ€”understanding the nuances of each other's work is crucial for effective partnership.

**Q&A and Discussion**
- The panel addressed questions and discussed topics such as:
   - **Investments in cyber resiliency** by states, including the creation of dedicated cyber response teams and red teaming.
   - **Involving universities** and students in these efforts, providing opportunities for hands-on learning and bridging the gap between academia and government.
   - **Implementing fixes** based on identified vulnerabilities, acknowledging the complexity of the election ecosystem and the need for collaboration with vendors.
   - **Encouraging government officials** to get involved, participate in vulnerability disclosure programs, and provide feedback on guidance and initiatives.

**Conclusion**
- The discussion emphasized the importance of collaboration between hackers and government officials for improving cyber security and election integrity.
- Ongoing efforts, such as vulnerability disclosure programs and educational events, were highlighted as steps towards building trust and resilience.
- The panel encouraged further engagement and provided contacts for those interested in getting involved.
