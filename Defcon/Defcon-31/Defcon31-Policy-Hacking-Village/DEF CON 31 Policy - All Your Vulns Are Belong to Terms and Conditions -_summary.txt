**Introduction**
- The panel discusses the evolution of vulnerability disclosure and the current landscape, including government initiatives and challenges.

**Panelists**
- David Rogers (Moderator): Created the CVD program at the Mobile Industries Association (GSMA) and has experience in fighting for its adoption.
- Katie Noble: One of the "Bug Bounty Katies," with a background in U.S. government and private sector cybersecurity.
- Harley Geiger: Cybersecurity lawyer with experience in government and private sector, focusing on hacker law and vulnerability disclosure.
- Casey Ellis: Founder and CTO of BugCrowd, a platform connecting security researchers with organizations for vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs. Co-founder of Disclose.io, a vulnerability policy standardization project.

**History and Evolution of Vulnerability Disclosure**
- The early days of the internet lacked security considerations, leading to the emergence of "hackers" who broke things out of curiosity.
- The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) was created due to fears about potential cyber threats, but it had a negative impact on the treatment of hackers.
- Over the years, there has been a shift from viewing vulnerability disclosure as a threat to recognizing its benefits, with the U.S. Department of Defense's "Hack the Pentagon" initiative being a turning point.
- Governments, including the U.S. and others, have started adopting coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) and providing legal protections for security researchers.

**Government Handling of Vulnerability Disclosure**
- The U.S. government has made significant progress, with initiatives like the Hack the Pentagon program and the creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
- All federal civilian agencies are now required to have a CVD program, and CVD is being incorporated into regulations and best practices.
- The Department of Justice (DOJ) has advocated for legal protections for security researchers under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the CFAA.
- Other countries, like Australia, Singapore, India, Turkey, and the UK, have also adopted vulnerability disclosure policies and laws.

**Challenges and Concerns**
- Some governments, like China, have vulnerability disclosure laws that require reporting to the government, potentially leading to a "giant sucking sound of vulnerabilities" flowing to them.
- The proposed EU Cyber Resilience Act includes strict timelines for disclosing actively exploited vulnerabilities, which may hinder mitigation efforts and expose vulnerabilities to adversaries.
- There is a tension between Western countries trending towards transparency as a resilience strategy and non-Western countries focusing on control and aggregation for offensive capabilities.
- The offensive market for vulnerabilities exists, and it can be challenging to distinguish between legitimate and oppressive uses of vulnerabilities.

**Bug Bounty vs. Vulnerability Disclosure Programs**
- Bug bounty programs are discretionary and provide incentives (rewards or reimbursements) for finding and reporting vulnerabilities, mimicking the economic incentives of adversaries.
- Vulnerability disclosure programs (VDPs) are a fundamental practice and act as a "see something, say something" channel for reporting vulnerabilities, with varying levels of authorization and legal cover for researchers.
- VDPs distribute access to security expertise and help organizations receive security feedback from a wider range of sources.
- Safe Harbor language in VDPs may include request-per-second limitations, which can be poorly written and restrictive for researchers.

**Audience Questions**
- The recent SEC regulation requiring public companies to report cybersecurity incidents within four days of determining materiality is concerning as it may lead to premature disclosures before incidents are fully contained.
- Some Safe Harbor clauses in VDPs include request-per-second limitations, which may be outdated and restrictive for researchers.
- As governments encourage vulnerability reporting, there is a risk of discrimination or restrictions based on the nationality of the reporter, especially in countries with more authoritarian regimes.
- Sanctions can impact vulnerability reporting, with U.S. companies potentially blocking submissions from researchers in embargoed countries to avoid sanctioned events.
