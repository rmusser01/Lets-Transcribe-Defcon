**Introduction**:
- **India McKinney**: Director of Federal Affairs at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
- **Topic**: The coming war on encryption and how to fight back

**FOSTA and SESTA**:
- **FOSTA**: *Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act*
- **SESTA**: *Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act*
- **EFF's Opposition**: These bills, while aimed at protecting children, would have negative consequences for free expression online.
- **Tech Companies' Response**: Some large tech companies chose not to oppose the bills due to concerns about negative PR.
- **Outcome**: The bills passed, leading to unintended consequences, including the removal of queer content and adult material.

**The Earn It Act**:
- A bill that establishes an unelected government commission to create best practices for the internet.
- **Consequence**: If companies don't follow these practices, they lose Section 230 protections related to child protection.
- **EFF's Response**: They received leaked bill text and mobilized their members to oppose it, resulting in over 50,000 people writing to Congress.
- **Current Status**: The bill has not received a floor vote but continues to be reintroduced.

**The Stop CSAM Act**:
- A bill that creates a carve-out to Section 230, allowing civil claims against online platforms for injuries involving CSAM.
- **Encryption's Role**: The bill specifically allows the use of encryption to be introduced as evidence of facilitation of illegal material.
- **EFF's Concerns**: This bill, with its seemingly positive title, poses a significant threat to encryption and private conversations.

**The Cooper Davis Act (S1020)**:
- Originally, a bill requiring platforms to report IP addresses of users discussing fentanyl to the DEA, regardless of legal or illegal use.
- **Amendment**: In committee markup, language was added to make facilitators liable if they "deliberately blinded themselves" to content, targeting encryption.

**Law Enforcement's Perspective**:
- **Testimony**: A former New Jersey cop stated that law enforcement should be able to see all messages to protect children from online exploitation.
- **Encryption as a Threat**: Law enforcement and some senators believe private messages create a vulnerability and want to eliminate encryption.
- **EFF's Response**: Emphasizing the importance of encryption for safety and security, and providing context to counter the notion of "a chance" of compromising encryption.

**Call to Action**:
- **Voting**: Privacy and data protection should be considered when voting for representatives.
- **Contacting Representatives**: Emphasizing the impact on constituents and requesting a response is crucial. Using EFF's Action Center or calling Congress directly are effective ways to make your voice heard.
- **Spreading the Word**: Sharing concerns with like-minded people and attending town hall events can create a significant impact and influence representatives' decisions.

**International Perspective**:
- **Australia**: Passed a backdoor law, potentially impacting open-source projects and leading to prosecution or lawsuits.
- **UK**: Apple has stated that if a bill targeting encryption passes, they will no longer offer iCloud and iMessage in the UK.

**Encryption's Support**:
- **US State Department and DOD**: Pro-encryption, requiring diplomats and active-duty service personnel to use encrypted platforms for communication.
- **Bipartisan Support**: While there is bipartisan support for removing encryption, there is also bipartisan opposition, highlighting the importance of grassroots support.

**Conclusion**:
- Emphasizing the ongoing nature of the battle against encryption and the need for continuous action.
- Encouraging attendees to contact their representatives and spread awareness to protect encryption.
