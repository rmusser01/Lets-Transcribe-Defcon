**Introduction:**
- Speaker: Nestori Sunilainen (Dr. Nestori)
- Works for SecureWorks as a Senior Principal Security Researcher
- Handles "Dr. Azure AD" and has a toolkit called "A8 Internals"
- Microsoft MVP in the security category and Microsoft's Most Valuable Researcher

**Microsoft SharePoint and Migration Tools:**
- Microsoft SharePoint Online (SPO) is a cloud-based service for content management and collaboration.
- Microsoft offers migration tools like Migration Manager and SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT) to move files from on-premises servers to SPO, OneDrive, and Teams.
- SPMT uses the same background APIs as Migration Manager and leverages the Granular Backup feature of on-premises SharePoint.
- Granular Backup is not available in SharePoint Online.

**Breaking Integrity of Microsoft Online Services:**
- Threat actors can exploit SPO migration APIs to break the integrity of Microsoft online services that use SPO as storage.
- This includes spoofing new content, tampering with existing content, and injecting custom code for XSS attacks.
- Leads to potential elevation-of-privilege attacks on services like Azure Active Directory.

**Demonstration of Spoofing and Tampering:**
- Dr. Nestori demonstrates how to create a new team in Microsoft Teams, which uses SharePoint in the background for document storage.
- By using SPMT, it is possible to spoof documents and tamper with existing ones, with full control over metadata (author, timestamps, etc.).
- This can be done by a site collection admin, which includes the person who creates the team.
- There are no logs of these actions, which can be a concern for auditing and security.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack:**
- Dr. Nestori discovered that the SPMT uses an old XML format for migration, which includes ASPX files (Active Server Pages Extended).
- This led to the hypothesis that it might be possible to replace design files using this API.
- By default, custom scripts are blocked in SharePoint Online to prevent potential XSS attacks.
- However, Dr. Nestori found a way to bypass this restriction using SharePoint Designer, an older tool that still works with SharePoint.
- The attack involves replacing the "allitems.aspx" file with malicious code that accesses the Graph API and shares the victim's OneDrive documents with the attacker.

**Reporting and Response:**
- Dr. Nestori reported the initial findings (spoofing and tampering) to Microsoft in November last year.
- Microsoft responded that it was working as intended and customers wanted to preserve metadata.
- The lack of logging was a concern, but Microsoft did not initially plan to fix it.
- Dr. Nestori later reported the XSS attack, which Microsoft categorized as spoofing at first.
- After discussions, Microsoft acknowledged the issue and worked on a fix.

**Recent Developments:**
- Dr. Nestori noticed that the XSS attack no longer worked due to a missing refresh token.
- Microsoft confirmed that they had fixed the issue, but it turned out to be unrelated to the actual exploit.
- Just before the talk, Microsoft deployed a global fix for the XSS attack within 24 hours of being notified.
- Dr. Nestori plans to release his updated toolkit to the public.
