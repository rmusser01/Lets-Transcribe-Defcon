**Introduction and Motivation**
- The speaker, Xavier, is a **vulnerability researcher** with an interest in exploring new techniques for bug detection.
- The talk focuses on using **LLMs** to **fuzz Python** code and the potential of this approach for the security community.
- Xavier is not an **AI or ML expert** but believes in the importance of adapting to new technologies.

**Background on LLMs and Fuzzing**
- **LLMs (Large Language Models)**: Machine learning neural networks trained on large text corpora from the internet (e.g., Wikipedia, GitHub, Reddit).
- LLMs predict the next most likely token in a sequence, allowing them to learn language syntax, context, and semantic understanding.
- OpenAI's models (3.5 and 4) are particularly effective for **code generation**, but other models like Google's BARD and Meta's open-source models also exist.
- **Limitations**: LLMs struggle with factual accuracy and have limited context due to token length constraints.
- **Fuzzing**: A security testing technique that sends random data to programs to identify divergent or unexpected behavior, commonly used for memory-managed software.

**Combining LLMs and Fuzzing**
- LLMs can be a **force multiplier** for software development, aiding in pair programming and code generation.
- OpenAI's API is recommended over tools like Copilot or the chatbox to avoid warnings about illegal activities.
- LLMs are beneficial for fuzz testing due to their ability to handle a large number of tasks and their scalability.

**FuzzForest: A Tool for Automating Fuzz Testing**
- FuzzForest is an **open-source tool** that utilizes LLMs to automate various stages of fuzz testing: installing, parsing source code, creating fuzz tests, fixing non-running tests, and triaging crashes.
- The tool extracts all functions from the code and stores them in a SQLite database, allowing for the generation of fuzz tests for specific functions or those matching certain criteria.
- The LLM is prompted with specific examples, API references, and directives to generate fuzz tests, which are then run and fixed if necessary using an LLM agent loop.
- The agent loop sends non-running code and output back to the LLM for correction, repeating this process up to a specified limit (e.g., 5 times).

**Fuzzing Engagement Process**
- Divided into three stages: recon, writing and running fuzz tests, and triaging crashes.
- During recon, the LLM is used to extract all functions, bypassing the need for manual identification of critical code paths.
- Fuzz tests are generated and fixed using the LLM, then run to achieve sufficient coverage.
- Crashes are triaged to determine their security impact, and vulnerabilities are reported to the development teams.

**Demonstration of FuzzForest in Action**
- Examples of fuzz tests generated by the LLM for popular Python libraries, including Twisted, Babel, Boto3, and the Python cryptography library.
- The LLM demonstrates an understanding of function specifics, error handling, and even references RFCs to create effective fuzz tests.

**Results and Analysis**
- FuzzForest identified **72 unique findings** (crashes) across 20 popular Python libraries, with **32** having a legitimate security impact.
- OpenAI's models (3.5 and 4) were compared, with 3.5 having a higher initial success rate but 4 producing more complex tests that required fixing.
- Cost analysis: OpenAI's models were more cost-effective, with 3.5 finding 46 unique crashes for 71 cents and 4 finding 65 crashes for $50.
- Other models, such as Salesforce and Repelit, were less successful in generating usable fuzz tests.

**Next Steps and Implications**
- Reporting bugs to Python development teams and expanding FuzzForest to support JavaScript.
- Improving prompts to enhance coverage, integrating additional models, and modifying the tool to write unit tests.
- LLMs will not eliminate software developers or security professionals but will lead to an increase in software creation, introducing new and subtle bugs.
- Adapting to new technologies and utilizing them effectively is crucial for the security community.
