**Introduction**
- **David Melendez** and **Gabriela Garcia** are presenting on the use of **SDR** in military drones. 
- **Gabriela**, also known as **Gaps**, is a security developer, hacker, and hacking community organizer. She is also a coding and cybersecurity instructor and mentor. 
- **David** is the author of *Hacking with Drones* and a fan of Capo's Party. 

**Drone Warfare**
- Drones have become **essential instruments of warfare**, offering **precision strikes**, **eliminating the need for onboard personnel**, and being **perfectly suited for symmetrical warfare**. 
- They offer numerous **advantages** in terms of **accuracy**, **reduced collateral damage**, **minimized human risk**, and **extended operational duration**. 
- Drones are also **cost-effective** compared to traditional manned aircraft, with **production methods** such as cardboard, wooden, and 3D-printed drones, as well as the use of **affordable chipsets**. 
- They are **strategic tools** for **real-time covert operations**, **surveillance**, and **data collection**. 
- Drones are also valuable for **SIGINT**, capable of **gathering information**, **intercepting**, and **analyzing enemy communications and electronic signals**. 
- They can access **challenging regions**, operate continuously, and transmit data in real-time. 

**Anti-Drone Measures**
- Anti-drone measures include the use of **thermal and standard cameras** for **shape recognition**, **detecting heat emissions**, **analyzing drone noise**, **RF and waveform detection**, and **identifying unique radio signatures**. 
- **Operators employ counterstrategies** such as **frequency hopping**, **unconventional jammers**, and **robust communication protocols**. 
- However, no drone can withstand a **direct physical attack**, such as a gunshot or stun. 

**Drones as War Elements**
- Drones are used for **SIGINT**, **extending reach to hard-to-access areas**, providing **real-time transmissions**, and **covert operations at high altitudes or discrete flight patterns**. 
- Typical anti-drone measures include **thermal and standard cameras** for **shape detection**, **detecting heat from electronics and motors**, and **artificial intelligence** for identification. 
- Another technique is **characterization of drone noise** and **RF and waveform detection**, as most drones use Wi-Fi communications. 

**Atropos and Interceptor Drones**
- **Atropos** is a **homemade quadcopter with a Wi-Fi router**, created over a decade ago. 
- It uses a **microcontroller** from **Microchip** and a **stabilization unit** from a **Nintendo** product. 
- The web page of the router is used for **telemetry control**. 
- To avoid **authentication attacks**, **beacon frames** are used, along with generating **fake drone frames** to hide the actual one. 
- **Interceptor** is a **smaller drone** with the same beacon system. 
- It uses **FM radio** to send commands and has **two-way communication**, allowing for **command transmission** and **telemetry reception**. 

**Arbitrary Frequency Generation**
- The latest approach is controlling the drone through **arbitrary frequency generation**. 
- A **custom frequency** is generated, and the drone receives it through an **SDR**. 
- The frequency can be changed **dynamically**, making it difficult for police guns to intercept. 

**Spread Spectrum**
- **Spread spectrum** is a **modulation technique** that **broadens the signal** across a wider frequency band. 
- It enhances **resistance to noise and interference** by spreading the signal and managing noise concentrated at a particular frequency. 
- **FHSS** (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) and **DSSS** (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) are key terms. 
- The innovation of spread spectrum is credited to **Hedy Lamarr** and **George Antheil**, who pioneered the system. 
- Their work laid the groundwork for **Wi-Fi**, **CDMA**, and **Bluetooth technology**. 

**Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)**
- FHSS is the technique used in this presentation. 
- The signal is generated by **toggling a GPIO pin** on the **B-Core**, creating a **radio signal**. 
- Changing the frequency of the toggling allows for **transmission at an arbitrary frequency**. 
- This technique uses **frequency hopping**, transmitting each message at a different frequency, pre-established between the transmitter and receiver. 

**I2S Bus and MediaTek MT7628**
- The **I2S bus** is used to transmit and receive digital audio. 
- It has a **clock pin** for data transmission and a **data receiving pin**. 
- The **clock pin** is constantly toggling. 
- By writing directly to the registers, the clock pin can be turned on and off to generate a **high-level and low-level modulation**. 
- The **clock dividers** can be configured to change the frequency, allowing for a wide range of frequency choices. 

**Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK) Modulation**
- The most simple modulation is **ASK**, similar to garage door remotes. 
- By turning the clock on and off, a modulation is created. 
- The receiver, an **SDR USB**, tunes to the frequency and receives the packets. 
- The receiver decodes the **binary transmission** by analyzing the **high and low levels**. 

**Transmitter and Receiver Setup**
- The transmitter has a **custom controller** with **joysticks**. 
- A **VCO** is attached to a **linear amplifier** to increase noise. 
- The receiver is another **B-Core** attached to an **SDR dongle**, which receives data at the specified frequency. 
- The receiver synchronizes with the transmitter by finding the first packet in a given frequency and following the list of frequencies. 

**Demonstration**
- The presenter demonstrates the transmitter's ability to **jump between frequencies**. 
- The spread spectrum technique transmits at one frequency and then changes to a neighboring one. 
- The presenter also mentions the possibility of transmitting at a **fixed but unexpected frequency**, which most jammers would not target. 
- The drone is shown flying outdoors, with the presenter assuring the audience that it has killed very few people (only three). 

**Conclusion**
- The presenters thank the audience for their attendance and invite questions.
