**Introduction**
- Presentation by cybersecurity researchers, Oliver and Andrea, on Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) interception and attacker behavior
- Utilized PyRDP, an open-source RDP interception tool, to collect data and record attacker activities
- Over 100 hours of video footage and 190 million events analyzed, leading to the characterization of attacker profiles and tools

**RDP Interception**
- RDP is a critical attack vector used by threat actors, including in ransomware outbreaks
- PyRDP enabled the collection of extensive data by intercepting and recording RDP sessions
- Crystal ball metaphor used to describe the ability to observe attacker activities through PyRDP

**Attacker Classes**
- **Rangers**: Stealthy attackers who perform reconnaissance, exploring folders, checking system and network performance, and running scripts
- **Thieves**: Monetize RDP access through proxyware, browser monetization, crypto mining, and android emulation for fraud
- **Barbarians**: Brute-force their way into systems, using tools like Masscan GUI to target specific countries and pivot into deeper networks
- **Wizards**: Skilful attackers who use RDP access as a portal to connect to other compromised systems, employing fileless techniques and leaving no artifacts
- **Bards**: Lack apparent hacking skills, using RDP for basic Google searches, watching porn, and downloading movies; may have purchased access from other attackers

**Attacker Tools**
- **XDIDZIC RDP Patch**: Creates admin accounts and patches RDP to allow concurrent sessions, enabling persistent access
- **NLBrute**: Effective RDP brute-forcing tool with a high detection ratio, used by attackers to compromise systems
- **Masscan GUI**: Wrapper around Masscan, making it user-friendly; used by barbarians to target specific countries and pivot into new networks
- **Silver Bullet**: Web application security tool similar to Burp, but with a focus on proxy usage and credential stuffing; widely shared on Telegram
- **Windows Defender Remove Script**: Legitimate software used to disable Windows Defender, with a zero virus detection rate
- **Defender Control**: Freeware tool used by ransomware groups to disable Defender, with a high detection ratio
- **Gamadine Mailer**: Turnkey phishing tool for spear phishing and spam campaigns, with a low detection ratio

**Attacker Observations**
- Attackers may work in teams, as evidenced by one attacker downloading tools while expressing disappointment to another via clipboard
- Some attackers do not speak English, as observed through their use of Google Translate to understand error messages
- RDP interception provides valuable intelligence, such as capturing an attacker's Telegram credentials and chat room activities

**Conclusion**
- RDP research and interception provide valuable insights into attacker behavior and techniques
- Researchers encourage Blue Teams to deploy their own traps and utilize RDP interception for effective alarm systems and management buy-in
- Law enforcement is urged to target ransomware groups, leveraging RDP interception to gather victim information and build cases
- The open-source nature of PyRDP and FQ binary parsing tool encourages collaboration and further development to combat cyber threats
