- Topic: Decoupling SIM cards from mobile phones/modems for advanced measurements and testing

**Motivation**
- Cellular networks have become complex with various operators, plans, and services.
- Roaming adds further complexity, involving home and visiting network operators.
- Traditional testing methods are costly, time-consuming, and limited in scope.

**Solution: MobileAtlas**
- **MobileAtlas**: An open-source framework that decouples SIM cards from cellular modems.
- **Geographically Decoupling Cellular Measurements and Exploitation**: Allows remote connection between SIM cards and modems, enabling global testing.
- Aims for scalability, automation, and control over background noise during measurements.
- Supports a wide range of features beyond data connections, including phone calls, USSD, and text messaging.

**Technical Details**
- SIM card protocol is 40 years old and designed for low-latency local communication.
- Extending it globally requires techniques to handle latency and voltage/speed differences.
- **SIM Provider**: Software that connects SIM card readers (PCSC, serial, or Android phone) to measurement probes.
- Current deployment includes 10 European countries and North America.

**Challenges and Solutions**
- **SIM Interface and Protocol**: Used a simple adapter with a short-cut diode to connect SIM slot to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
- Negotiated speeds, voltages, and parameters independently on SIM provider and modem sides.
- Added waiting time extensions and tested up to 1000 ms latency.
- **Traffic Metering**: Used Linux network namespaces to isolate measurement processes and control background traffic.
- Employed binary encoding for precise measurement and delayed traffic accounting.

**e-SIMs and Carrier Perspective**
- e-SIMs are not widely available and have limitations on device transfer and supported plans.
- **SIM Tunneling**: Used for over-the-top bypass fraud (international calls terminated locally).
- MobileAtlas does the opposite, tunneling from domestic to abroad for testing.
- Carriers may benefit from such a system to verify services and configurations, especially for VoLTE roaming.

**Surprising Results**
- **IMSI**: Books state it as a unique SIM identifier, but they found SIMs that dynamically update IMSI for roaming network selection.
- **USB Device Limit**: Theoretically, 127 devices, but practically challenging to exceed 20-30 due to hardware, driver, and power issues.

**Ethical Considerations**
- **Modems vs. Software-Defined Radios (SDRs)**: SDRs offer more capabilities but focus on specific access technologies and regulatory issues.
- Modems are globally certified, safer for open-source applications, and don't expose users to radio regulatory problems.
- Ensure responsible testing without enriching themselves (e.g., letting expire traffic not accounted for in tests).

**Showcase: Internet-Related Measurements**
- Focus on **seriating** (unmetered access to specific applications) and billing measurements.
- Analyzed seven operators in three countries, finding WhatsApp, Snapchat, Facebook, and Messenger as popular apps.
- Studied metrics used for traffic classification: TCP/UDP port, IP address, packet inspection, time to live, and machine learning.
- Experimented with spoofing host headers and IP addresses to detect IP-based and host name-based classification methods.
- Found operators using both methods, sometimes in combination, and cases of wrongful billing or lack of seriation during roaming.

**Exploiting Seriation**
- Host name-based classification can be exploited by spoofing host data or TLS handshake fields (similar to domain fronting).
- IP-based classification is more complex, requiring a server to spoof IP addresses, but feasible for downlink UDP traffic.
- **Spoofify**: A proof-of-concept implementation using a VPN and kernel module to rewrite IP addresses for free internet access.

**Showcase: Privacy-Related Measurements**
- **Ringback Tones**: Audio feedback when calling someone, issued by the terminating operator, vary by region and operator.
- Recorded and analyzed ringback tones to differentiate operators and countries, enabling location tracking with a single test call.
- Also useful for SIM swapping, identifying the responsible home operator.

**Showcase: Proactive SIM Communication**
- Full access to SIM-modem communication revealed instances of SIM cards "phoning home" by sending covert binary SMS messages.
- Occurred in the background, unknown to smartphone users, and even during roaming.
- Analyzed content, finding user equipment and SIM card information.

**Conclusion**
- MobileAtlas enables efficient and comprehensive testing, providing insights into roaming inconsistencies and vulnerabilities.
- Showcased measurement capabilities, including seriation exploitation, location tracking via ringback tones, and proactive SIM communication.
- Emphasized the open-source nature of the project and invited collaboration from interested parties.
