**Introduction**:
- **Ron Ben-Yizhak**: Security researcher at Deep Instinct, interested in privilege escalation and bypass techniques.

**Privilege Escalation Techniques**:
- **Overview**: Techniques to gain higher-level permissions on a system, useful when compromising a weak process.
- **Token Duplication**: Duplicating primary tokens of another process and launching a child process with elevated privileges.
- **Handle Duplication**: Accessing tokens in another process's handle table and duplicating them for privilege escalation.
- **Impersonation**: Abusing common RPC servers to impersonate high-privilege threads, commonly used by offensive tools.

**Windows Filtering Platform (WFP)**:
- **Overview**: Native Windows OS component for controlling and filtering network traffic, allowing development of security products like firewalls and IDS.
- **Components**: Caller drivers, filter engine, and Base Filtering Engine (BFE).
- **Functionality**: Allows blocking or allowing network traffic based on various fields like application path, user, address, and port.

**Reverse Engineering RPC Calls**:
- **Starting Point**: Mapped RPC methods to find ways to manipulate benign services, leading to the discovery of interesting RPC methods in the BFE RPC client.
- **Process**: Analyzing the pseudocode of RPC client, server, and kernel driver functions to understand how tokens are accessed and duplicated.
- **Discovery**: Finding an undocumented hash table in the TCP/IP driver that stores tokens and other sensitive data.

**Abusing Windows Filtering Platform**:
- **Overview**: Bypassing security mechanisms and exploiting the platform for privilege escalation.
- **Technique 1**: Duplicating handles to the ALE device and sending device I/O requests directly to bypass restrictions and gain access to the hash table.
- **Technique 2**: Utilizing IPsec to insert tokens into the hash table, leveraging the fact that IPsec metadata includes process tokens.
- **Technique 3**: Targeting the "OneSync Svc" service running as a logged-on user, leveraging an undocumented RPC method to gain lateral movement capabilities.

**Detection and Further Research**:
- **Detection**: Monitoring for new IPsec policies, correlating RPC calls with IPsec policies, and detecting device I/O requests to the ALE device by unauthorized processes.
- **Log-based Detection**: Analyzing Windows Filtering Platform logs, but finding them insufficient for detecting the attacks due to lack of relevant data.
- **Further Research**: Encouraging the community to explore the TCP/IP driver further, specifically the hash table and explicit credentials stored within.
