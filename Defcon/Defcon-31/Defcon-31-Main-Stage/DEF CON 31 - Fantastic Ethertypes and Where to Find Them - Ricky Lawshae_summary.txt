**Introduction**
- **Speaker**: Ricky Lawshae (Headless Zeke)
- **Topic**: Exploring various **uncommon** and **local network-only** Ethernet protocols (**EtherTypes**) and their potential **security implications**
- **Experience**: Offensive IoT researcher, 5th time speaking at DEF CON

**EtherTypes Explained**
- Defined in **IEEE 802.3** standard
- Located in the **first two bytes** after **destination and source MAC addresses** in an **Ethernet frame**
- Indicates the **type of payload** following the header, allowing **switches** to process the data accordingly
- **Values below 15** indicate **frame length**, **above 1563** indicate EtherType, and values in between are **undefined**
- Registering an EtherType costs a **one-time fee** of **$3,810**
- **Special EtherTypes**: **0xADA5** and **0xADA6** for **prototyping**, **0xADA7** for **extending the address space** with an **Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)**

**Network Management**
- **SNMP (EtherType: 0x814C)**: Allows management of devices without IP access, similar to its use in traditional networks
- **Potential Abuse**: SNMP's well-known vulnerabilities can be exploited, possibly bypassing firewall restrictions
- **Realtek Remote Control Protocol (RRCP) (EtherType: 0x8899)**: Allows unmanaged switches with specific Realtek chipsets to be managed remotely
- **Authentication**: Uses a **two-byte authentication key** (default: **2379**), which is **easily brute-forceable**
- **Functionality**: Provides direct **memory access** and **register modification**, enabling VLAN manipulation and trunk port configuration
- **Realtek Data Sheets**: Comprehensive, providing detailed **register maps** and information
- **Cisco MOP (EtherType: 0x6001/0x6002)**: Maintenance Operation Protocol, part of the outdated DECnet protocol stack, still enabled by default on Cisco routers
- **Functionality**: Allows **memory dumping** and provides a **remote console** for system recovery when regular access is unavailable
- **Potential Abuse**: Memory dumping could be used to obtain credentials, enabling further exploitation via the remote console

**Industrial Electrical**
- **GOOSE (Generic Object-Oriented Substation Events) (EtherType: 0xADAB)**: Used in **power substations** for communication between **smart devices**, enabling **event broadcasting** and **IO operations**
- **Security**: IEC 62351 standard adds security but is often **not implemented due to low-latency requirements**
- **Potential Abuse**: An attacker could **broadcast false events** or **manipulate IO devices** to disrupt power distribution
- **KEPCO PLC Interoperability Protocol (EtherType: 0x893D)**: Enables communication with **smart meters** installed by the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO)
- **Details**: Limited information available, possibly used for **two-way communication** with smart meters over power lines
- **Potential Abuse**: An attacker could **manipulate power distribution** or **steal electricity** by exploiting this protocol
- **HomePlug AV (EtherType: 0x88E1)**: A **power line communication (PLC)** standard enabling Ethernet connectivity over power lines, commonly used for whole-home networking and EV charging stations
- **Security**: Employs **128-bit AES encryption**, **rotating network keys**, and **device-specific keys** for security
- **Potential Abuse**: An attacker could join the network by obtaining **network management keys** or **forcing devices to join their network** using **device encryption keys**

**Transportation**
- **TechMP (Technically Enhanced Capture Module Protocol) (EtherType: 0x99FE)**: Used for capturing and replaying **CAN** and **FlexRay** data in vehicles, aiding remote diagnostics
- **WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments) (EtherType: 0x88DC)**: Enables communication between **autonomous vehicles**, **infrastructure**, and **emergency vehicles**, improving safety and enabling remote control
- **Potential Abuse**: An attacker could **spoof messages** to manipulate traffic lights, send misleading location-based ads, or compromise autonomous vehicles
- **Train Communication Network Protocol (EtherType: 0x894C)**: Consists of **Ethernet Train Backbone (ETB)** and **Ethernet Consist Network (ECN)**, enabling communication within and between train cars
- **Potential Abuse**: An attacker could **manipulate train data**, such as **length** or **door control**, by exploiting this protocol

**Medical**
- **Philips Clinical Network (EtherTypes: 0x885B/0x885C)**: Possibly related to IntelliView, used for patient monitoring and data exchange
- **Potential Abuse**: An attacker could **spoof patient data**, triggering false alarms or interventions, or disclose sensitive information
- **Massachusetts General Hospital (EtherTypes: 0x815F-0x8163)**: Registered EtherTypes with unknown functionality, possibly related to patient imaging data transfer

**Robotics**
- **Remote Tech Hazardous Duty Robot Protocol (EtherType: 0x889E)**: Likely related to Northrop Grumman's Andros Titus line of **unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs)** for bomb disposal and hazardous situations
- **Potential Functionality**: Based on a previous **serial control protocol**, it may allow **remote control**, **firmware updates**, and **weapon manipulation**
- **Potential Abuse**: An attacker could **hijack control** of the robot or **manipulate its weapons** during critical operations

**Demos**
- **Cisco MOP**: Using the MOP RC Linux utility to access the management console of a Cisco 1800 series router without explicit MOP configuration
- **HomePlug AV Key Extraction**: Using a Scapy script to extract **network management keys** and **device encryption keys** from a HomePlug AV adapter

**Conclusion**
- Layer 2 networking offers a wealth of interesting and unconventional EtherTypes with potential security implications
- Further exploration and research are encouraged, especially in unique environments
