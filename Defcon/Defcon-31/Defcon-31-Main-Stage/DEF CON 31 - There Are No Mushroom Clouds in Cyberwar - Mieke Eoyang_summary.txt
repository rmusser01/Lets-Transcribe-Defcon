**Introduction**:
- Mieke Eoyang's presentation at DEF CON 31 discusses the **history of cyberwarfare** and its misconceptions.
- The association between **nuclear deterrence** and **cyber conflict** has influenced popular culture and policymakers.

**The Impact of Media and Popular Culture**:
- The movie *WarGames* shaped **President Ronald Reagan's** concerns about potential hacking into U.S. weapons systems.
- This led to the establishment of the **Department of Defense's** (**DoD**) first **cyber command** under the **U.S. Strategic Command**.
- Concepts like **mutually assured destruction** and **mutual hold at risk** guided the DoD's initial approach to cyber strategy.

**The Evolution of Cyber Threats**:
- The DoD initially focused on potential **"cyber 9/11"** or **"cyber Pearl Harbor"** scenarios, anticipating a major cyber attack with catastrophic effects.
- However, the reality of cyber operations is often **ephemeral**, with effects that are **hard to attribute** and **rarely decisive**.
- The turning point in U.S. cyber strategy occurred before the **2018 midterm elections**, adopting a "defend forward" approach to actively disrupt malicious cyber activity.

**The Role of the Private Sector and Volunteers**:
- The recognition that **cyberwarfare is pervasive** highlights the critical role of the **private industry** and **individual volunteers** in protecting Americans and strengthening global allies.

**Cyber in War vs. Cyber War**:
- There is a significant difference between **cyber in war** and **cyber war**.
- Cyber attacks during Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 demonstrated that cyber operations are not as devastating as initially theorized.
- Cyber attacks did not cause the Ukrainians to surrender, and the expected **"Cyber Pearl Harbor"** scenario did not materialize.

**Integrated Deterrence**:
- The focus has shifted to **integrated deterrence**, utilizing cyber as one of the tools of national power alongside other options like sanctions, law enforcement actions, or kinetic attacks.

**The Cyber Trilemma**:
- The **cyber trilemma** involves the factors of **speed**, **intensity**, and **control**.
- The DoD optimizes for **control**, ensuring precision and adhering to the rules of armed conflict.

**Cyber Offense and Defense**:
- The DoD has prioritized sharing insights and **TTPs** (tactics, techniques, and procedures) with partners and the private sector to defend against cyber threats.
- The "Shields Up" activities and technical assistance provided by the **NSA's Cyber Security Collaboration Center** are examples of this new approach.

**The Need for Skilled Cyber Professionals**:
- The DoD recognizes the need for skilled cyber professionals to help identify and disrupt malicious cyber activity targeting Americans.
- The presentation concludes with a call for collaboration between the DoD and the cyber community to address the evolving cyber threat landscape.
