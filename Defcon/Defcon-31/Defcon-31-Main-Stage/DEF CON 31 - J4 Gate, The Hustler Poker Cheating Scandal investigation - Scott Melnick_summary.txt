**Introduction**
- **Scott Melnick**, also known as Ducky, is a Principal Security Research and Developer for Bulletproof.
- He has over 13 years of experience in the gaming industry and holds more than six patents.

**Hustler Casino Live Scandal**
- In **November 2022**, a newcomer, Robbie J. Lude, won a $269,000 pot on Hustler Casino Live, a popular online streaming real money game poker tournament.
- Lude was accused of **cheating** her opponent, Garrett Adelstein, a top cash player, by making a questionable call with a weak hand.
- The incident sparked widespread **controversy** and accusations of cheating, with internet sleuths and poker players debating her guilt.

**The Investigation**
- Melnick was hired by Hustler Casino Live to conduct an investigation into the cheating allegations and address various **conspiracy theories**.
- He examined the possibility of cheating through:
    - Signaling devices (e.g., vibrating rings, sex toys, TENS units)
    - Rigged card shufflers
    - Unsecured communications to the booth
    - Special sunglasses
    - RFID card reading
- Melnick also considered the role of a **Hustler Live Productions employee** who stole $15,000 worth of chips from Lude and was accused of being her partner in crime.

**Card Shufflers**
- Melnick discussed the two types of card shufflers: single-deck and multi-deck shufflers.
- Single-deck shufflers ensure there are 52 cards and shuffle them randomly, while multi-deck shufflers know the count and face values of the cards.
- Multi-deck shufflers were previously found to be **vulnerable to cheating** by accessing the list of cards with a device like an iPhone.
- Melnick recommended additional security measures, such as securing the shuffler between games and using tamper-proof tape.

**RFID Conspiracies**
- Melnick tested the theory that Lude used an **RFID reader** in her water bottle to capture her opponent's cards.
- He consulted with experts and conducted his own tests, concluding that it was **highly unlikely** for her to successfully read the RFID cards from that distance while bypassing the dealer's cards.

**Signaling Devices**
- Melnick investigated the possibility of Lude using a signaling device, such as a vibrating ring, TENS unit, or sex toy, to receive cues from an accomplice.
- He considered factors such as distance, line of sight, and the effectiveness of these devices through various materials.
- The investigation yielded **inconclusive** results, and Melnick emphasized that only Lude truly knows the truth.

**Math and Probability**
- Melnick calculated the probability of winning the hand in question, finding it to be a **53% to 47% chance** in favor of Lude's opponent.
- He questioned whether someone with knowledge of the cards would risk going all-in with only a slight advantage.

**Conclusion**
- Melnick emphasized the value of diverse knowledge and skills, attributing his ability to conduct the investigation to his participation in events like **DEF CON** and the friends he made in the hacking community.
- He expressed gratitude to various individuals and groups who contributed to his investigation and provided insights into different aspects of technology.
