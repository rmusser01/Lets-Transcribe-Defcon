**Introduction**
- **Paul** and **Thomas**, researchers from the **SONAR R&D team**, present on **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** security.
- They explore the **attack surface**, **vulnerabilities**, and **security measures** of VS Code, a popular **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**.

**VS Code Overview**
- **Electron-based**: Built on **Node.js** and **Chromium**, enabling web-based versions like **github.dev** and **vscode.dev**.
- **Highly extensible**: Supports a wide range of **extensions** published on the **VS Code marketplace**.
- **Language Server Protocol**: Facilitates language support across different editors, reducing development effort.
- **Open-source**: Approximately **800,000 lines of code** on **GitHub**, with some **proprietary parts** in the Microsoft version.

**VS Code Architecture**
- **Component-based**: Splits functionality into **privileged** and **less privileged processes**.
- **Privileged processes**: Include the **main process**, **shared process** (hosting terminals and utilities), and **extension host process**.
- **Renderer process**: Chromium-based, responsible for UI rendering, with limited access to the file system and command execution.
- **Isolation and communication**: Different components communicate via **IPC interfaces**, with **origin restrictions** enforced by the **same-origin policy**.
- **Debugging**: Supported via **Chromium developer tools** and **VS Code's built-in debugging features**.

**Attack Surfaces and Vulnerabilities**
- **Exposed network services**: VS Code extensions often expose network services, creating potential security risks due to lack of proper security measures.
- **Argument injection**: Demonstrated through vulnerabilities in the **Rainbow Fart** extension and VS Code's built-in **Git extension**.
- **Workspace settings**: Sensitive settings, such as `git.path`, can be overridden, leading to potential command injection.
- **Workspace Trust**: A security feature introduced in 2021 to reduce the impact of malicious folders, but with limitations and potential bypasses.
- **Browser-based vulnerabilities**: XSS attacks are possible due to the built-in browser in VS Code, leveraging extensions and Markdown injection.
- **Built-in browser exploitation**: Examples include the **Markdown Preview** extension, **Jupyter Notebook** extension, and **command links** in Markdown strings.
- **Third-party extensions**: Popular extensions like **GitLens** and **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** extension were found to have vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.

**Bug Bounty and Reporting Process**
- **Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)**: Used for reporting vulnerabilities, with centralized communication and transparency.
- **Bounty discrepancies**: Disagreement over the inclusion of built-in extensions in the bug bounty scope, leading to a $30k bounty awarded and then retracted.
- **CVEs and patches**: Highlight the importance of thorough patching, as some vulnerabilities were bypassed due to incomplete fixes.

**Conclusion and Takeaways**
- **CVEs as indicators**: Buggy components are often targeted, and thorough patching is essential to prevent bypasses.
- **Workspace Trust considerations**: Clicking "Trust" can have security implications, and users should exercise caution when trusting folders.
- **Unclear security threat model**: Developer tools often lack clear security guidelines, leaving users uncertain about potential risks.
- **Principle of least surprise**: Emphasizing the importance of transparency and user awareness in security measures.
- **Need for improved security**: Encouraging developer tools to prioritize security and provide clear guidance to users.
