**Introduction**
- Speaker: Marcello (Bytebleeder)
- Topic: Email security vulnerabilities
- Disclaimer: Presentation contains sensitive information, and the speaker advises against illegal activities

**Cloudflare Workers**
- Serverless computing platform distributed across Cloudflare's CDN for geographical latency optimization
- Supports JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly
- Worker code is publicly accessible by default

**Mail Channels**
- Email transactional service with cybersecurity features
- Partnership with Cloudflare allows sending emails through Cloudflare Workers
- No authentication required for their API, accessible only via Cloudflare IPs
- Allows sending emails from any domain, including those not controlled by the sender

**Testing and Results**
- Sender used a publicly available Cloudflare Worker to send test emails
- Test emails from non-existent or uncontrolled domains failed or went to spam
- Emails from domains using Mail Channels, including boston.gov and notepad++.org, landed in the inbox with SPF and DMARC passing
- Further investigation revealed that Mail Channels is the largest player in the email transactional space with a 42% market share

**Sender Policy Framework (SPF)**
- Security control for the "from" field in SMTP, allowing authorized IPs and hostnames to send emails on behalf of a domain
- Mail Channels customers include "include" statements in their SPF records, allowing all Mail Channels customers to spoof each other's domains
- Alternative services like SendGrid and Mailgun offer additional security measures like sender identity verification and dedicated sending IPs

**Vulnerability Disclosure**
- Speaker contacted Mail Channels in November 2022 about the issue, with no response
- Rapid7, a company that aggregates internet-wide data, assisted in further investigation and contacted Mail Channels in January 2023
- Mail Channels CEO responded, stating they didn't consider the SPF issue a vulnerability
- Mail Channels introduced "domain lockdown mode" in June 2023, allowing customers to specify authorized Cloudflare Workers or disallow Mail Channels from sending emails on their behalf

**Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) and DMARC**
- DKIM: Cryptographic authentication providing a way to verify that an email was sent by the purported domain
- DMARC: Security control for the "from" field visible to the email recipient, allowing senders to specify how receivers should handle unauthenticated emails
- Out of 2 million Mail Channels customers, only 407 had any DMARC record, and only 105 used DKIM
- Testing revealed that even with DMARC and DKIM set up, spoofed emails still passed SPF and landed in the inbox

**Authenticated Received Chain (ARC)**
- Experimental protocol designed for email forwarding scenarios, guaranteeing chain of custody but not preventing spoofing
- ARC headers record authentication results at each hop, but Mail Channels doesn't check SPF, DMARC, or DKIM results
- Presence of ARC passing in email headers can improve spam score, increasing the likelihood of phishing emails landing in the inbox
- Domains without SPF, DMARC, or DKIM records can be potentially spoofed with a higher success rate, expanding the blast radius to over 3 billion domains

**Demo and Conclusion**
- Speaker attempted to demonstrate the vulnerability but encountered technical difficulties
- Emphasized the importance of email security and encouraged organizations to review their SPF records and implement domain lockdown mode with Mail Channels
- Acknowledged the assistance of researchers and Rapid7 in the investigation
