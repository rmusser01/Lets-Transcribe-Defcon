**Introduction**
- Speaker: Patrick Wardle, founder of the Objective-C Foundation
- Topics covered: Apple's macOS Background Task Management (BTM), reversing malware detection, macOS internals, etc.

**Background Task Management**
- **Overview**: Introduced in macOS 13, BTM governs and consolidates **persistent items** or "background tasks."
- **Persistent items**: Processes that automatically re-execute upon system reboot or user login (e.g., auto-updaters, malware).
- **BTM's Visual Indicators**: When an item is installed that persists, three things happen:
    - A system alert informs the user.
    - A security message is broadcast, notifying security tools.
    - The item is registered in the BTM database.

**Why BTM Matters**
- **For Defenders**: Provides a centralized subsystem to manage and detect persistent items, including potential malware.
- **For Hackers**: Poses challenges due to user alerts and security messages, requiring new approaches for silent persistence.

**Internals of BTM**
- **Log Analysis**: Analyzing logs with full logging capability enabled provides insights into BTM's components and behavior.
- **Key BTM Components**:
    - **SMD (System Management Daemon)**: Monitors file system events and communicates with BTM via XPC messages.
    - **BTM Daemon**: Core component that manages persistent items, updates the BTM database, and interacts with other processes via XPC.
    - **BTM Agent**: Displays user alerts and notifications regarding persistent items.
- **BTM Database**: Contains information about all persistent items, but it's proprietary and undocumented, requiring reverse engineering to access.

**Writing Tools to Leverage BTM**
- **Dumping the BTM Database**: Apple's SFL tool can dump the BTM database, but it requires a private entitlement. Reverse engineering SFL tool reveals methods to deserialize database objects programmatically.
- **Open-Source Library: dump BTM**: Allows developers to query the BTM database and integrate BTM functionality into security tools.
- **Real-time Persistence Detection**: macOS's Endpoint Security subsystem allows security tools to register for notifications when persistent items are added or removed. However, the removal event is currently broken.

**Bypassing BTM**
- **Overview**: Bypassing BTM involves suppressing user alerts and preventing endpoint security messages from being delivered.
- **Method 1: Resetting the BTM Database**: Using Apple's SFL tool to reset the database confuses the BTM daemon, preventing the user alert. Requires root access.
- **Method 2: Suspending the BTM Agent**: Sending a stop signal to the BTM agent (running as the user) prevents the user alert from being displayed.
- **Blocking Endpoint Security Messages**: Analyzing the BTM daemon's code reveals a kernel bug where the responsible process for persistence is not found, causing an error and preventing the endpoint security message.

**Detecting BTM Bypasses**
- **Resetting the BTM Database**: Write a process monitor to detect when the SFL tool is used to reset the database, or use endpoint security events to block the reset command.
- **Suspending the BTM Agent**: Use endpoint security to register for signals and block the stop signal from being sent to the BTM agent.
- **Endpoint Security Notifications**: While the BTM launch item add event is bypassable, file notifications (e.g., notify create, notify write) are not susceptible to the kernel bug and can be used for persistence detection.

**Takeaways**
- BTM, despite being a new security feature, is poorly implemented and trivial to bypass, leading to a false sense of security for users and security tools.
- The speaker's non-profit organization focuses on Mac security and raises money for various causes, including recent wildfowl relief efforts in Maui.
- The speaker has written free books on Mac malware, reverse engineering, and security tool development, with Volume 2 covering topics discussed in the talk.
