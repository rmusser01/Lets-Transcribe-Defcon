**DEF CON 31 Talk: "All Information Looks Like Noise Until You Break the Code"**
- **Speakers**: Pekoske, Lyngaas, Easterly
- **Topic**: Cybersecurity threats and strategies, with a focus on transportation and critical infrastructure.

**Introduction:**
- **Cyber Threats**: Increasing against America's pipelines, railroads, and aviation systems.
- **TSA's Approach**: Working with **White House**, **Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)**, and **Congress** to improve resilience.
- **Goal**: Not prescribing specific security measures, but asking regulated parties to produce plans for protecting critical assets.

**Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack (2021):**
- **Impact**: Systemic across the East Coast.
- **Immediate Response**: TSA and CISA collaborated to implement a **reporting requirement** for critical infrastructure owners and operators.
- **Centralized Reporting**: Reports go to CISA, who then shares with affected agencies, reducing confusion and improving efficiency.
- **Harmonization of Reporting Requirements**: Recognized as a **best practice** and a key part of the national cyber strategy.

**Regulations and Partnerships:**
- **Performance-Based Model**: TSA pivoted from prescriptive activities-based requirements to a performance-based approach.
- **Outcomes over Activities**: Operators propose plans to achieve desired outcomes, then report on implementation and achievement of those outcomes.
- **Collaboration and Information Exchange**: Regular updates and threat briefings with CEOs, CIOs, and CISOs of critical infrastructure companies.
- **Target-Rich, Cyber-Poor Sectors**: Hospitals, K-12 schools, water facilities, and local election offices are priority sectors for TSA and CISA.
- **Sector Risk Management Agencies**: CISA works with these agencies to ensure they have the necessary resources and best practices to reduce risk.

**Recruiting and Collaboration:**
- **DEF CON Presence**: TSA and CISA are actively recruiting technical experts and seeking input from the hacker community.
- **Project Chariot**: A partnership between TSA, CISA, DHS Science and Technology Directorate, Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, Federal Railway Administration, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
- **Goal of Project Chariot**: Prioritize risks to rail and pipeline sectors and develop threat scenarios for tabletop exercises to improve resilience.
- **Ransomware Defense**: Emphasis on secure-by-design technology and shifting market demands towards safer, more secure products.

**Threat Landscape:**
- **Epoch-Defining Threats**: AI and China.
- **China's Capabilities**: Potential to use cyber attacks for disruption and destruction, especially in the event of a conflict in the Taiwan Straits.
- **Resilience**: Emphasis on preparing for potential attacks with resilience, including identifying high-value assets, manual overrides, and recovery strategies.
- **Ukraine as a Case Study**: Demonstrates the importance of cyber, operational, and societal resilience in the face of kinetic attacks.

**Closing Remarks:**
- **Gratitude**: Speakers thank the DEF CON community for the welcome and the opportunity to collaborate.
- **Invitation to Join**: Encourage attendees to consider working with TSA and CISA to address cybersecurity challenges.
- **Upcoming Talk**: "Beers and Bears" with Scott Shapiro, author of *Fancy Bear Goes Fishing*.
