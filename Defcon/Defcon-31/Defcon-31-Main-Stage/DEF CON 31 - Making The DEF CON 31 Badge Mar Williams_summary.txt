**Penrose Tiles and Community:**
- DEF CON badges are **Penrose tiles**, a form of periodic tiling.
- Two types of rhombi: **fatter** human badges and **skinnier** inhuman badges.
- Badges can be physically connected to create a mosaic, symbolizing the unique communities formed by DEF CON attendees.
- Website (**spux.art**) allows attendees to create their own unique tiles with colors, shapes, and handles.

**Badge Manufacturing Challenges:**
- Issues with custom colorants and mold breaking impacted production.
- Backup badges with floppy plastic inserts provided to compensate for delays.
- Efforts to resolve issues: Bonnie flew to Chicago, rented a truck, and drove badges to Vegas.
- Potential plan for badge trade-ins next year for those with floppy plastic badges.

**Design Process and Challenges:**
- Initial concepts explored blow-molded badges and ferro fluid interactions with magnets.
- Creating a 3D model suitable for injection molding presented challenges.
- Manufacturing issues: colorant shortages, mold repairs, and production delays.
- Explored alternative methods like pad printing and sticker solutions.

**Lanyard Puzzle:**
- Lanyards feature characters as part of a puzzle.
- Uber lanyard image will be available on Sunday for reference.

**Art and Design Philosophy:**
- Good design is **invisible**, focusing on interaction and showcasing individuality.
