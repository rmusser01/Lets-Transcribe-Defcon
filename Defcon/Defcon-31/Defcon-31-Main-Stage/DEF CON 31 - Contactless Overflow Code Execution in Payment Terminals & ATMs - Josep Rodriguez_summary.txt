**Introduction**
- The presentation discusses **code execution vulnerabilities** in **NFC payment readers** found in **ATMs**, **point-of-sale systems**, and other devices.
- The vulnerabilities affect a wide range of vendors and can lead to potential financial impact and card data stealing.

**NFC Payment Readers and Their Functionality**
- NFC payment readers are used in various scenarios, including portable point-of-sale devices, transportation payment systems, ATMs, parking machines, and vending machines.
- The focus of the research is on the **IDTech Kiosk 3** NFC reader, which is commonly used in ATMs and other payment systems.
- The IDTech Kiosk 3 consists of an NFC antenna and chip connected to a microcontroller that handles credit/debit card information and USB communications.
- During a transaction, the reader and the card communicate using **APDU** (**Application Protocol Data Unit**) at the application layer.

**Emulating a Card to Exploit the Reader**
- To test the security of the NFC reader, the researcher used a device with the **NXP PM532 chip** to emulate a card and send specific commands.
- Another approach is to create an **Android application** using **Host Card Emulation** to interact with the NFC reader.

**IDTech and Their Payment Devices**
- IDTech is a global leader in payment devices, offering a range of products such as pin pads, touch screens, and displays.
- Their devices are used in various industries, including retail, hospitality, and parking.
- All IDTech devices share the same codebase for their firmware, making them vulnerable to the same code execution issues.

**Identifying and Exploiting the Vulnerability**
- The researcher extracted the firmware from the IDTech Kiosk 3 device and began reverse-engineering it to locate the code responsible for reading card data.
- The researcher discovered that the firmware supported **extended APDUs**, which can be up to 65,000 bytes in size, and found a **stack buffer overflow vulnerability** in the function that reads card data.
- By sending an extended APDU larger than the buffer size, the researcher was able to gain control of the PC register and achieve code execution.
- The IDTech devices lacked exploit mitigations and secure boot, making it easier for an attacker to exploit and persist on the device.
- The researcher also found 21 additional functions in the firmware that were vulnerable to stack buffer overflows.

**Demonstration of the Exploit**
- The researcher demonstrated the exploit using a video, showing how the Kiosk 3 device crashes when the proof-of-concept code is executed.
- The researcher also showed how the exploit can be weaponized to display a message on the screen, indicating that the device has been compromised.

**Impact of the Vulnerability**
- An attacker who gains code execution on the microcontroller can inject malware and manipulate transactions, such as changing the price or stealing credit card data.
- The researcher also discussed the possibility of attacking the host computer connected to the reader through USB by exploiting vulnerabilities in the IDTech SDK used by customers.
- By compromising the host computer, an attacker could potentially perform a jackpot attack on an ATM.

**The ATM Scenario**
- The researcher highlighted their experience working with ATMs and their components, such as gas dispensers and USB devices.
- They emphasized the presence of the IDTech Kiosk 3 reader in major ATM brands and the potential impact of compromising the firmware through NFC.
- The attacker could steal credit card data or perform a jackpot attack by compromising the ATM computer and interacting with the hardware, such as the cash dispenser.
- The researcher also mentioned the possibility of modifying the firmware to act as another USB device and target vulnerabilities in the ATM's USB drivers.
- They concluded by emphasizing the importance of patching the firmware of the NFC reader and ensuring the security of the SDK or driver used in the ATM computer.

**Disclosure and Vendor Response**
- The researcher contacted all affected vendors, and they confirmed that they fixed the issues.
- However, not all vendors provided the fixes, and the lack of remote update capabilities for some devices posed a challenge in deploying the patches.
