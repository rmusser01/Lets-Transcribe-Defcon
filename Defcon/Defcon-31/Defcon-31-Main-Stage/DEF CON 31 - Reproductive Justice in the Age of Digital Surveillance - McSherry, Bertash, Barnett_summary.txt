- **Legislative efforts**: Working to pass data sanctuary laws and limit dragnet surveillance at the state level, especially in blue states.
- **Technological tools**: Building and promoting the use of tools to protect privacy and security, such as secure communications, mobile device security, and compartmentalization.

**The Role of Companies and Nonprofits**
- Companies and nonprofits should re-evaluate their data retention and collection practices to protect individuals' privacy.
