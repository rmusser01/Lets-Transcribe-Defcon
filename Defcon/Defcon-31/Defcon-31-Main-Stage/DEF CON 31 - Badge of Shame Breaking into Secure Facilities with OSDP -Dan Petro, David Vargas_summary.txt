**Introduction**
- **Dan Petro**: Senior Security Engineer at Bishop Fox, previously a long-time pentester at the company
- **David Vargas**: Senior Consultant with the Red Team at Bishop Fox
- Discussion topic: Breaking into secure facilities

**RFID Badge Reader Systems**
- **Components**: Door, lock, and reader
- **Reader's role**: Accepts badge, forwards badge number to the controller
- **Controller's role**: Authenticates and authorizes entry, sends signal to flash green light if entry is allowed
- **Wiegand**: Current protocol used, unencrypted, allowing for badge cloning and replaying

**OSDP (Open Supervised Device Protocol)**
- **Intended as a replacement for Wiegand**: Provides encryption and supports multiple readers on the same bus (RS485)
- **OSDP-SC (Secure Channel extension)**: Adds encryption, not mandatory, leaving some installations unencrypted
- **RS485**: Allows daisy-chaining of readers, all messages are broadcast, enabling potential access to secure doors via less secure side doors

**OSDP Protocol Issues**
- **Ineffective sequence numbers**: Only 2 bits, not providing sufficient security against replay attacks
- **HMAC issues**: Only 32 bits retained, rest discarded, reducing security and enabling potential birthday attacks
- **Session key derivation**: Uses only 48 bits of entropy from the backend server's nonce, potentially weakening encryption

**Downgrade Attack**
- Exploits the ability of OSDP devices to choose encryption or not
- Manipulates the capabilities request to indicate lack of encryption support, resulting in unencrypted data transmission

**Protocol WTFs**
- **What Are We Paying by the Bit Now?**: Inadequate sequence numbers and HMAC handling, potentially enabling replay attacks
- **Stop Making Null Ciphers**: Secure channel setup messages (SCS 15 and 16) leave data fields unencrypted, exposing data to eavesdropping
- **Install Mode Attack**: Persistent install mode allows attackers to request and obtain the encryption key from the controller
- **Encryption Is Not Magic Fairy Dust**: Lack of asymmetric cryptography, relying on a default key for initial encryption, providing a false sense of security

**Defense Strategies**
- **Configuration**: Ensure encryption is enforced, disable install mode, and prevent downgrade attacks
- **Reader Installation**: Consider physically connecting new or reconfigured readers directly to the controller to avoid insecure key exchange over production wires
- **Tamper Alarms**: Respond promptly to tamper alarms, consider additional physical controls or camera surveillance
- **OSDP Verified Devices**: Prioritize purchasing OSDP-verified devices to ensure encryption support and proper implementation
- **Caution**: Don't assume security just because encryption is used; cryptographic protocols are complex and vulnerable to implementation errors
