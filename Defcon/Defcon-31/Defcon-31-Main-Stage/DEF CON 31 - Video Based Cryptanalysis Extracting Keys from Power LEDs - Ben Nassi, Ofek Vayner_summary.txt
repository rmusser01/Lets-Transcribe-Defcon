**Introduction**
- **Ben Nassi** and **Ofek Vayner** present a new method of **video-based cryptanalysis** to extract cryptographic keys.
- This technique uses video footage of a device's power LED, demonstrating the risk to information confidentiality.

**Background**
- Previous research in 2014 introduced the **visual microphone**, recovering speech by analyzing video footage of objects.
- The **LEM phone attack** uses a **photodiode** to recover speech by measuring light intensity from a desktop light bulb.
- **Glow-O-Matac** extends this concept, recovering speech from the power LED of speakers.

**Optical Cryptanalysis**
- Power consumption of a device affects the intensity of its power LED, creating a correlation between power consumption and optical measurements.
- This correlation allows for cryptanalysis by analyzing optical measurements from the power LED using a photodiode.
- **Raspberry Pi** experiments revealed a correlation between power consumption and LED intensity up to 500 kHz.
- RSA, ECDSA, and SIKE keys can be recovered using this technique.

**Video-Based Cryptanalysis**
- The primary disadvantage of optical cryptanalysis is the need for specialized equipment like photodiodes.
- Video cameras are more accessible and can be used to obtain optical measurements from power LEDs.
- **Rolling shutter** effect in video cameras can increase the effective sampling rate by three orders of magnitude.

**Threat Models**
- **Closed Video Acquisition**: Uses a smartphone's video camera, targeting any power LED with physical access.
- **Over-the-Internet Video Acquisition**: Exploits an internet-connected video camera to target Type 2 power LEDs that indicate operation execution.
- **Rolling Shutter**: Exploits the rolling shutter effect to increase the sampling rate and detect rapid changes in LED intensity.

**ECDSA Key Recovery**
- The **Minerva attack** exploits runtime optimizations in cryptographic libraries to recover ECDSA keys.
- By analyzing video footage of a smart card reader's power LED, the signing time of ECDSA signatures can be estimated, enabling key recovery.
- The experimental setup involved an internet-connected video camera 16 meters away from the smart card reader.
- The signing time was calculated by analyzing the color changes in the video frames, indicating the start and end of signing operations.
- The Minerva attack script was then used to recover the complete ECDSA key.

**SIKE Key Recovery**
- The **Herzblied attack** is a timing attack that recovers SIKE keys by analyzing the execution time of cryptographic operations.
- The experimental setup involved an iPhone capturing video footage of the power LED of speakers connected to a Samsung Galaxy S8.
- By averaging the frames and analyzing the green channel, the start and end of cryptographic operations could be detected.
- The execution time distribution was used to set a threshold and determine the key bit values with 99% accuracy.
- An error detection and correction mechanism was applied to recover the complete SIKE key.

**Limitations and Takeaways**
- The attack primarily targets weak IoT devices, up to the level of smartphones.
- The semi-uniform distribution of sampling due to the transition time between frames is a limitation.
- Power LEDs are more informative than expected, posing a risk to information confidentiality.
- The potential of the attack is greater than demonstrated, as improved video camera specifications and the increasing number of weak IoT devices will make more devices vulnerable.
- Video-based cryptanalysis is intended for non-compromised devices and uses commonly available equipment.

**Conclusion**
- This research highlights the vulnerability of power LEDs to video-based cryptanalysis, even with ubiquitous cameras and weak IoT devices.
- The presented attacks demonstrate the recovery of cryptographic keys from smart card readers and smartphones.
- The potential impact of this research was recognized with the Pony Award for the best cryptographic attack of 2023.
