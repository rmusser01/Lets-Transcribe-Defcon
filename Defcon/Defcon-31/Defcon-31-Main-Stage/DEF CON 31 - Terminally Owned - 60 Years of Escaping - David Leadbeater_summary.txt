**Terminal Vulnerabilities and Exploits:**
- **Terminal History:**
  - American Standard Code for Information Interchange (**ASCII**) introduced the **Escape** character, which has been used since the first publication of the standard 60 years ago.
  - **Teletype Model 33:** One of the first devices to use ASCII, released in 1963.
  - **ADM3A Terminal:** Introduced by Leah Siegler in 1976, it was one of the first affordable terminals with cursor positioning capabilities and played a role in the development of the VI editor.
  - **VT100 Terminal:** Released in 1978, it implemented the X3.64-1979 standard (known as **ANSI**), which defined additional control sequences for ASCII.
- **Escape Sequences and Attacks:**
  - **Escape Sequences:** Used to perform actions like cursor positioning, setting margins, and changing colors.
  - **OpenBSD VT100 Emulator Bug:** Sending specific escape sequences could cause a kernel panic or reboot due to bounds checking errors.
  - **ANSI.SYS Driver:** Introduced in DOS 2.0, it allowed for redefining keys and creating art using escape sequences and custom characters.
  - **ANSI Bombs:** Prank attacks that redefined keys to perform unexpected actions when certain keys were pressed.
  - **Flash.C Terminal DOS Attack:** Sent malicious escape sequences to mess up a user's terminal, causing issues like screen inversion and character substitution.
- **CVE and Exploitation Techniques:**
  - **H.D. Moore's Research (2003):** Published vulnerabilities in terminal emulators, including the ability to set window titles and exploit them for potential attacks.
  - **Title Reporting Vulnerability:** Exploiting the ability of some terminals to reply with a user-controllable string, allowing for potential command execution.
  - **Curl and DNS Delivery Methods:** Demonstrating how malicious escape sequences can be delivered to terminals using tools like curl and DNS lookups.
  - **Apple Terminal Vulnerability:** Information leakage issue where a malicious server could write escape sequences to the terminal via DNS, potentially exfiltrating data.
  - **Python Free HTTP Command Line:** Demonstrating how a terminal vulnerability can be combined with a Python logging issue to execute arbitrary code.
  - **Git for Windows (Git Bash) and LESS Bug:** Exploiting a vulnerability in LESS's OSC 8 hyperlink handling to write escape sequences to the terminal via Git commit logs.
  - **Top and Docker Escape:** Exploiting a bug in top's optional graphics support to set environment variables and potentially escape Docker containers.
  - **Windows Terminal and Kubernetes:** Demonstrating how a vulnerability in Windows Terminal could be used to attack a Kubernetes administrator by writing escape sequences to the termination log file.
- **Protection and Mitigation:**
  - Treat terminals like browsers, dealing with untrusted inputs.
  - Ensure correct output escaping and secure settings.
  - Consider using basic terminals like ST to limit exposure to potential vulnerabilities.
