**Introduction**
- DEF CON 31 talk on hacking power management in data centers
- Speakers: Sam Quinn and Jesse Chick, security researchers

**Data Center Overview**
- Data centers can refer to the facility, individual cage spaces, or co-located server racks
- **Critical components**: power equipment, PDUs, and DCIM systems
- **Cloud Migration**: Many companies are moving operations to the cloud, increasing the focus on data center security
- **National Cybersecurity Strategy**: Prioritizes defending critical infrastructure, including data centers

**Targeted Products**
- **DSIM (Data Center Infrastructure Management)**: Used to manage, configure, and monitor data center components, often remotely
- **CyberPower PowerPanel Enterprise**: A DSIM software with default credentials and an authentication bypass vulnerability
- **PDU (Power Distribution Unit)**: A glorified power strip for rack servers/network switches, accessible via a web-based management interface
- **Dataprobe iBoot PDU**: A specific PDU model with a cloud service and a firmware image containing multiple vulnerabilities

**DSIM Attack Vector**
- **Default Credentials**: Found in the database installer scripts, encrypted but decryptable due to lack of protection in C# code
- **Authentication Bypass**: Utilizing non-ASCII characters or LDAP functionality to bypass login checks and gain access to the admin console
- **Command Injection**: Exploiting user-controlled input in the net use function to execute commands with system privileges
- **Impact**: Ability to manage data center infrastructure, read logs, and potentially pivot to other devices within the data center

**PDU Attack Vector**
- **Emulation**: Used Kimu emulator to set up a virtual environment and interact with the device at the process level
- **Authentication Bypass**: Deserialization of untrusted data, allowing an attacker to direct the device to query an arbitrary database and match credentials
- **Database Dump**: Exploiting a flaw in the export functionality to download an unencrypted tar file containing sensitive data, including plain text passwords
- **Command Injection**: Discovered through triaging custom binaries, format strings, and function calls, allowing arbitrary command execution as root

**Exploitation Scenarios**
- **Pivoting**: Using the compromised DSIM to access and control devices within the data center, such as PDUs
- **Power Manipulation**: Turning power on and off rapidly to cause hardware issues or perform a DDoS attack
- **Persistence**: Establishing a foothold within the data center network by executing code on the compromised PDU

**Takeaways**
- **Hard-Coded Credentials**: Still prevalent, can enhance the impact of an attacker's exploit, and should be avoided
- **Low-Hanging Fruit**: Simple techniques like command injection can be effective, so always look for basic vulnerabilities first
- **Research on a Budget**: Downloading and emulating publicly available firmware can lead to significant findings without high costs
- **Criticality vs. Quality**: Discrepancy between the critical nature of data center products and the quality of their software
- **Call to Action**: A reminder to hold the industry accountable and prioritize secure design principles
