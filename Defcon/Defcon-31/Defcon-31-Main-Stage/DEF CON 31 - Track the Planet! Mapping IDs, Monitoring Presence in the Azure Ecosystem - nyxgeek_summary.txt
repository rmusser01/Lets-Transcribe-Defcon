**Introduction**
- Speaker: Nick Skeak
- Topic: User enumeration in **Azure** and its implications.

**User Enumeration**
- Definition: Determining if a user is valid on a system.
- Importance: Enables attacks like **password sprays**, phishing, and targeted **RCE**.
- Facilitates identification of targets, especially when email addresses contain real names.
- Common in **pen testing** to reduce the list of potential targets.
- **Microsoft Azure**:
   - Widespread adoption, including Fortune 500, state and federal government agencies.
   - Contains user information disclosures that can be weaponized.

**OneDrive Enumeration**
- Silent and leaves no logs, making it ideal for large-scale enumeration.
- Requires knowledge of domain and tenant names, which can be identified using tools like **AAD Internals** and **Clue**.
- **OneDrive Enum**: Tool developed by the speaker for enumeration, with a total operating budget of $5,000.

**Results of User Enumeration**
- Over 24 million user names found, with about 10 million unique names.
- Common user name formats include "John Smith" and "J. Smith".
- User enumeration possible even with high turnover or long retention policies.

**Presence Enumeration**
- **Teams** presence enumeration: Monitoring users' online presence and out-of-office messages.
- Enabled by default, allowing anyone to message people in an organization.
- **Graph Explorer**: Contains a feature for presence lookups, even without authentication.
- **Team Filtration**: Tool for presence enumeration, taking advantage of an anonymous presence lookup in the source code.
- Allows tracking of a company's daily activity and identifying schedules and habits of specific individuals.

**Guest Enumeration**
- Possible to enumerate guest users in Azure, revealing potential business relationships.
- Default settings allow guests to invite other guests, creating ambiguity about the nature of connections.
- **Dr. Azure AD**: First to discover guest enumeration, with a method published four years ago.
- Guest enumeration is not considered a vulnerability and is out of scope for pen testing, but it provides a roadmap for attackers.

**Conclusion**
- User enumeration is a serious issue that should be addressed by Microsoft.
- Large-scale user enumeration, presence monitoring, and guest relationship identification are possible with minimal investment.
- Emphasizes the need for Microsoft to take user enumeration seriously and make necessary changes.
