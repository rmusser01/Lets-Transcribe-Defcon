**Introduction**
- The speakers are vocational high school students from Medford, Massachusetts, with an interest in making and breaking things.
- They are part of an underwater robotics team called Sunk Robotics.
- Their talk will cover how they reverse-engineered Boston's CharlieCard fare system, with the potential for free rides.

**The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)**
- The MBTA is Boston's public transit agency, managing buses and subways.
- It is the oldest transit system in the country.
- Fares for the subway are $2.40, and for buses, $1.70.

**Previous Hacking Attempts**
- Around 15 years ago, MIT students hacked the MBTA's trolley tickets, adding values of up to $600.
- The MBTA obtained a restraining order to prevent the students from presenting their research at DEF CON.
- The research was released into the public domain, inspiring the speakers.

**Initial Attempts**
- The speakers chose to focus on the MBTA's trolley cards, assuming they used NFC or RFID technology.
- They purchased various NFC readers, eventually settling on the PN532 model, which worked successfully.
- They discovered that the cards used MyFair Classic, an infamous flavor of the MyFair standard, with a proprietary 48-bit encryption algorithm.
- They obtained the necessary encryption keys from a publicly available repository.

**Cloning Cards**
- The speakers were able to clone cards by copying data from one card to another, using a process called XOR.
- Cloned cards can be detected and disabled by the MBTA.
- Cloning requires an upfront investment, and if a card is disabled, the money is lost.

**Forging Cards**
- Forging cards involves reverse-engineering the data storage and manipulation process.
- The speakers examined hex dumps of card data, looking for patterns related to money values.
- They discovered that the money value is stored in half-penny increments and that there are two transaction registers.
- They developed a repeatable strategy to create cards with a value of up to $327.67.

**Reverse Engineering Process**
- The speakers isolated variables and used XOR operations to modify card data.
- They created a lookup table to automate the process and refined their strategy to avoid adding quarters each time.
- They were able to create cards with custom values and card types, such as employee cards.

**Disclosure to the MBTA**
- The speakers contacted the MBTA to disclose their findings, inspired by a similar story involving Bobby Roush.
- The MBTA invited them to their headquarters to discuss their research and how to prevent future incidents.
- The speakers demonstrated their ability to edit card information, including money value and card type.

**Conclusion**
- The speakers emphasize that their research should not be used for illegal purposes.
- They thank the audience for their attention and invite further questions.
