**Introduction**
- Talk given at DEF CON 31 by Trevor Stevado and Sam Haskins of Loudmouth Security
- Focuses on **physical access systems** and their vulnerabilities

**Physical Access Systems**
- Components: **card**, **reader**, **back-end access controller**, **lock**
- Reader reads credential from card, sends to access controller for validation
- Access controller confirms validity, sends signal to lock to open door

**Card-to-Reader Interactions**
- Technologies: **HID prox**, **HID iClass**, **Mifare Classic**, **CEOS** (**HID**), **Mifare Desfire** (**NXP**)
- Purpose: validate physical presence of credential at specific time

**Types of Attacks**
- **Card-cloning**: capturing data from card, writing to new card
- **Downgrade**: reading data from card with standard reader, encoding on lower frequency/security card
- **Replay**: capturing, replaying sequence of messages between card and reader
- **Relay**: focus of presentation; relaying RFID card signal over long distance

**History of Access Control Technologies**
- **HID prox**: simplistic, card broadcasts ID when energized, easily cloned
- **HID iClass**: introduced shared key between card and reader, proprietary cipher reverse-engineered
- **Mifare Classic**: uses keys for each sector, proprietary algorithm reverse-engineered
- **CEOS** and **Mifare Desfire**: use industry-standard ciphers, no public cloning techniques for CEOS

**Relay Attack Scenario**
- Attacker sends individuals near legitimate employee with Proxmark and near target door with Proxmark
- Communication between Proxmarks via internet, acting as fake reader and card
- Messages relayed between real reader and real card, responses sent back
- Reader can only detect attack through **timing variations**

**ISO 14443 Type A (14A)**
- Messaging layer for application-specific data, e.g., **CS protocol** or **Desfire protocol**
- **14A handshake**: exchange of parameters before application-layer data, not encrypted or authenticated
- **UID CLN message**: card provides UID to reader, not used by CS due to lack of authentication
- **ATS message**: includes **frame waiting time integer (FWT)**, unauthenticated, sent by card

**Frame Waiting Time (FWT)**
- Tells reader how long to wait between frames before expecting response from card
- Can be modified to make reader accept **ridiculous amounts of latency**
- Highest value of 14 results in wait time of **4,949 milliseconds**

**Original Design**
- Extension of HF Replay Proxmark standalone mode by Salvador Mendoza
- Used laptops, BlueShark Bluetooth add-on, web socket connection
- Successful test: unlocking door in Ottawa with card in Florida
- Reliability issues due to battery level affecting Proxmark's ability to read card
- Latency issues: real cards designed for response within milliseconds, not orders of magnitude

**Revised Design**
- Swapped laptops with phones, Bluetooth with serial link, powered Proxmark from phone
- Software: HFCardHopper, new module for Iceman's Proxmark 3 firmware, inspired by Salvador Mendoza's design
- Supports any ISO 14443A protocol, relays initial UID and DATS
- Custom Android app for easy interface with Proxmark, supports card/reader modes, adjusts FWT
- Custom hardware: USB-to-UART bridge module, ribbon cable for connection to Proxmark

**Results**
- Tested on various HID readers: RP40, RPK40, Signo (00, 01, 02)
- Card technologies: CEOS, EV1, interested in testing EV2 and EV3
- Distances: successful tests from 12 feet to 2,400 miles (Vegas to Ottawa)
- Prevalence of technologies: older technologies still in use, small market percentage for newer ones
- Most access control industry vulnerable to some form of attack

**HID's Response**
- Responsible disclosure through BugCrowd, triaged and responded
- Did not accept recommendation to limit FWT due to compliance and backward compatibility
- Majority of end users do not see relay attacks as viable threat
- Suggested mitigations: second factor (PIN/biometric), mobile credentials
