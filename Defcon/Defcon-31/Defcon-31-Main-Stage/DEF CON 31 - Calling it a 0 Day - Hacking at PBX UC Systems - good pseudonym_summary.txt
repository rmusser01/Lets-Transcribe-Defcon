**Introduction**:
- PBX (**Private Branch Exchange**) and UC (**Unified Communications**) servers facilitate internal and external communications in enterprise environments.
- The speaker has experience in embedded systems and enterprise perimeter research, with a focus on reverse engineering.

**PBX/UC Systems Overview**:
- PBX systems evolved from traditional telephone exchanges to digital and software-based solutions.
- UC servers provide additional features like video, text, and other contemporary communication methods.
- Examples include Asterisk, FreeSwitch, FreePBX, 3CX, and SIPXCOM.

**Attack Surface of PBX/UC Servers**:
- SIP, Inter-Asterisk Exchange Protocol, MGCP, RTSP, XMPP, MySQL, DNS, and web management interfaces.
- Authentication and user account management are also potential attack vectors.

**Case Studies**:
- **SIPXCOM**: Written in Java, open-source, includes an optional XMPP server called SIPXOpenFire.
   - A message interceptor vulnerability allows arbitrary arguments to be passed to curl commands, enabling file read/write primitives.
   - By overwriting the OpenFire service file, an attacker can gain root shell access.
   - Vendor response was poor, with no action taken to address the issues.
- **FreePBX**: Maintained by Sangoma, based on Asterisk, with a web interface and various free/paid modules.
   - Uses PHP and Ioncube for code obfuscation, potentially to protect license checks in paid modules.
   - An authentication bypass vulnerability allows MAC address spoofing, leading to potential RCE.
   - Additional command injection and path traversal vulnerabilities were also discovered.
   - Sangoma's disclosure process was disappointing, with a lack of communication and ineffective patches.

**Takeaways**:
- PBX systems have a complex threat model due to various user types, permissions, and functionalities.
- Command injection vulnerabilities remain prevalent in PBX servers.
- Open-source bugs can persist for years without being addressed.
- Code obfuscation can be broken, and its effectiveness as a security measure is questionable.
- Vendor cooperation varies, emphasizing the importance of independent research and verification.
