**Introduction**
- The future of **hacking**, **cybersecurity**, and **human rights** are at risk due to a proposed UN cybercrime treaty.
- The **treaty** could reshape **anti-hacking laws** and impact **security researchers** and **coders**.
- With **Russia** and **China** initially involved, there are concerns about the potential impact on **security researchers' rights**.

**Background on the Proposed UN Cybercrime Treaty**
- The **UN** is negotiating a draft **cybercrime treaty** that could reshape anti-hacking laws worldwide.
- There is already an existing international **cybercrime treaty**, the **Budapest Convention**, with 64 signatories, which has been criticized for various issues.
- **Russia** proposed a new **cybercrime convention** at the UN in 2017 due to concerns about the Budapest Convention infringing on national sovereignty.
- In 2019, the **UN General Assembly** adopted a resolution creating an **ad hoc committee** to elaborate on the proposed convention.
- Geopolitics has played a complex role in the negotiations, with some countries pursuing their own agendas, which could compromise **human rights protections**.

**Concerns with the Zero Draft of the Treaty**
- The **Zero Draft** of the treaty contains five chapters on **criminalization**, **domestic and cross-border surveillance**, **technical assistance**, and **proactive measures**.
- There are concerns about the weakness of the **human rights** articles in the draft, with some countries wanting to delete them entirely.
- The draft includes an article on **international cooperation** that removes the application of **human rights** obligations, which is concerning.
- Countries like **India**, **Russia**, **China**, **Iran**, **Syria**, **Egypt**, and **Tonga** have proposed concerning changes, such as deleting references to international human rights obligations.

**Impact of Treaties and the Need for Limitations**
- **Treaties** are binding on signatory countries, and some provisions compel states to adopt certain laws, while others allow for flexibility.
- However, too much flexibility can be problematic, especially when it comes to **criminalization** and **surveillance powers**.
- The speaker emphasizes the need for limitations and safeguards to protect **human rights**, especially regarding **computer access without authorization**.
- The treaty could lead to **diplomatic issues** and complicate the situation for **security researchers** and **journalists**.

**Specific Concerns with the Treaty's Articles**
- The speaker highlights concerns with **Article 22**, which allows countries to claim **jurisdiction** over crimes, leading to potential issues with **extradition** and **surveillance powers**.
- They provide a scenario to illustrate the potential issues, involving a **security researcher** from a democratic country accessing a database in an authoritarian country, containing sensitive information about dissidents from another authoritarian country.
- The speaker calls for the deletion of **Article 22** to prevent authoritarian regimes from legitimizing illegal practices and compromising human rights.

**Proposed Safeguards and Protections**
- The speakers from **EFF** advocate for stringent **limitations** and **safeguards** on **human rights abuses** within the treaty.
- They propose setting **time limits** on investigative powers, ensuring **effective remedy** for wrongly targeted individuals, and requiring **prior judicial review** of surveillance powers.
- They also want to see **transparency** in reporting the use of these powers and a clear definition of **"competent authorities"** to prevent overreach by prosecutorial authorities.
- They highlight concerns with **Article 28**, which could force security researchers to disclose **vulnerabilities** to government authorities.

**Next Steps and Call to Action**
- The next intensive round of negotiations will take place in **August-September** 2023, with a potential final draft and signatories expected by **January-February 2024**.
- The speakers urge the audience to follow the process closely and stand up for **users' rights** and the rights of security researchers to prevent criminalization in the international forum.
