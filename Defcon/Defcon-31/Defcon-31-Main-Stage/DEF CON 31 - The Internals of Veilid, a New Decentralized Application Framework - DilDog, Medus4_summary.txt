**Introduction**
- Speakers: Christian Dildog-Ryu and Caitlin Medusfor Bowden, members of the Cult of the Dead Cow
- **Veilid** is an open-source, peer-to-peer, mobile-first networked application framework.
- Veilid aims to provide a **privacy-focused communication platform and protocol** to defend human and civil rights.

**Overview of Veilid**
- Veilid is conceptually similar to **IPFS** + **Tor** but faster and designed for private, decentralized communications.
- Written in **Rust**, Veilid runs on various platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, WASM).
- Uses standard internet protocols: **UDP**, **TCP**, and **WebSockets**.
- All nodes are equal, and the network gains strength from popular apps, supporting less popular ones.

**Design Goals and Features**
- **Security** and **privacy** are paramount, with strong cryptography and private routing.
- **Resiliency** to handle mobile networks and context switching.
- User-friendly and accessible to everyone, not just technically inclined individuals.
- **Upgradable crypto system** to future-proof against technological advancements.
- **Secure storage** with encryption and device-level secrets (keychains, key stores).
- **Distributed hash table (DHT)** for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Private routing** to protect IP addresses, similar to Tor but with enhanced privacy and speed.

**Cryptography and Security**
- **VLD zero** cryptography suite includes ed25519 for authentication, Curve25519 for key exchange, and XSalsa20-Poly1305 for encryption.
- **Message digests** use Blake3, and key derivation uses the 2015 Password Hashing Competition winner.
- **Upgradable crypto system** allows for future changes without disrupting existing data.
- **Private routing** ensures neither node can control the entire route, protecting against adversarial nodes.

**Development and Community**
- Veilid is written in **Rust**, with crates available on GitLab and soon on crates.io.
- Power users can run their own **Valid Server** with packages available for Debian, APT, and RPM.
- Supports multiple programming languages: **Flutter**, **Dart**, **JavaScript**, and **Python**.
- Community engagement: Twitter, Mastodon, Discord, and GitLab.

**Conclusion**
- Veilid aims to provide a privacy-focused communication platform accessible to everyone, protecting human and civil rights.
- By combining strong cryptography, private routing, and decentralized storage, Veilid offers a secure and resilient framework for applications.
- The project welcomes contributions from coders, hackers, and regular people to build a diverse and inclusive community.
