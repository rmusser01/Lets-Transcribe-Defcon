**Introduction**
- **Gal Zror**: A vulnerability research manager at Cyborg Labs presents on real-time video and audio deep fakes.
- **Disclaimer**: The presented technology can be harmful, and users should always consider the potential consequences of their actions.

**Deepfakes:** **The Basics**
- **Deepfakes**: Synthetic media generated by **AI** models, typically involving face and voice swaps.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Refers specifically to **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, a class of ML used for image and audio recognition.
- **Training a Model**: Involves providing a data set and an algorithm, allowing the model to recognize patterns and make predictions.
- **GPU**: Graphics Processing Unit, essential hardware for the mathematical calculations required to train ML models efficiently.

**Video Deepfakes**
- **Data Collection**: High-quality videos of the target are gathered from sources like YouTube, company websites, or virtual meetings.
- **DeepFaceLab (DFL)**: A project by Ipirov for creating offline video deepfakes, requiring configuration of various parameters.
- **Real-time Deepfakes**: Building on offline deepfakes, they use models trained on diverse data sets to perform face swaps in real time.
- **DeepFaceLive**: A software that runs DFL models in real time, enabling face swaps during video conferences.
- **Staging**: Additional effects and props (e.g., background, beard, hairstyle) enhance the realism of the deepfake.
- **Limitations**: Real-time deepfakes may struggle with certain facial expressions and objects covering the face, and require a powerful GPU.

**Audio Deepfakes**
- **Speech-to-Text**: Technology that converts speech into text, with some services requiring as little as one minute of clear audio sample.
- **Voice Conversion (VC)**: A technique that converts voice samples and supports multiple languages and singing.
- **Real-Time Voice Conversion (RVC)**: Requires a minimum of 10 minutes of clear audio data set and creates a model that can convert any voice into the target's voice.
- **VoiceChanger**: A project by Okada that runs RVC models and redirects audio output to other programs, enabling voice deepfakes during calls.
- **Limitations**: RVC models may struggle with constant syllables and require a powerful GPU, which can introduce latency.

**Social Engineering with Deepfakes**
- **Impact**: Real-time deepfakes enable attackers to impersonate supervisors or CEOs, requesting sensitive information or instructing employees to take harmful actions.
- **Consequences**: Potential business damage, money transfer, job termination, data leakage, and business fatigue due to increased security measures.
- **Attack Process**: Data collection, staging a story, and automation are key steps in executing a successful social engineering attack with deepfakes.
- **Mitigation**: Awareness, multi-factor authentication, ML-based detection methods, commercial products, and phishing notifications can help defend against deepfake attacks.

**Conclusion and Future Work**
- **DEF CON Video Art**: A script that automates the process of creating deepfakes, using pre-trained models and best practice configurations.
- **Future Plans**: Full-head deepfakes, experimentation with different data sets, automation enhancements, and further research.
