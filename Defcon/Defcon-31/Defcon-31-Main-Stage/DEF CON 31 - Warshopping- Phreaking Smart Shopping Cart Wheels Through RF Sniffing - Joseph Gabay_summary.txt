**Introduction**
- Speaker: Joseph Gabay
- Topic: Reverse engineering and bypassing the security features of a new type of smart shopping cart wheel, the Rocateq system.

**Background**
- Previous work: Gabay previously presented on a similar topic at DEF CON 2 years ago, focusing on ultra-low-frequency communication and how to sniff and replay signals.
- New brand of wheel: Rocateq, with a focus on anti-shoplifting features.
- Disclaimer: This project was conducted on personal time with personal equipment, and does not reflect the speaker's employer or professional work.

**Overview of Smart Shopping Cart Wheels**
- **Function**: Prevent cart removal or shoplifting, and provide tracking functions.
- **Common features**: Ultra-low-frequency communication (around 10kHz), mechanical braking mechanism, and the ability to receive lock and unlock commands.
- **Manufacturers**: Gatekeeper Systems and Rocateq.
- **Locking mechanisms**: Internal wheel expansion, or a plastic piece covering the wheel to prevent forward movement.
- **Perimeter wire**: Buried wire in parking lots or integrated into supermarket tiles, broadcasting a radio signal at ultra-low frequencies.

**Previous Methods for Capturing Signals**
- **Loop stick antenna**: Ferrite core and enamel wire wound together, soldered to a headphone jack to trick devices into thinking it's a microphone.
- **Drill**: Used to wind the antenna, with a little balancing for impedance matching.
- **Phone**: Older model with a headphone jack, used to record signals as audio files.
- **Playback**: Signals can be played back through a speaker to control the shopping cart.

**Rocateq System**
- **Discovery**: The speaker's father acquired a locked Rocateq wheel, prompting further investigation.
- **Marketing materials**: Emphasize RF receiver for data upload and download, and long battery life.
- **FCC filings**: Provide detailed information on frequencies, bands, and test procedures for Rocateq's systems.
- **Perimeter lock signal**: Prevents carts from leaving the parking lot.
- **Arming lock signal**: Activates when carts are brought into the market, triggering a lock if they're taken out again.
- **Unlock signal**: Unlocks a locked cart.
- **Megahertz-level alarm mute**: Mutes the alarm.
- **Per-check signal**: Sent from the checkout counter to the wheel, indicating payment and allowing exit without triggering the alarm.

**War Shopping**
- **Equipment**: Laptop, SDR, loop stick antenna connected to a phone, audio recorder app, and GQRX for signal recording.
- **Procedure**: Engineer a situation where the cart locks, capture the unlock signal sent by the store clerk, and analyze the signals.
- **Signals captured**: Perimeter lock, arming lock, unlock, megahertz-level alarm mute, and per-check signals.
- **Per-check signal analysis**: Played back as a sound, this signal can be used to unlock the shopping cart.

**Freaking the Wheels**
- **Definition**: Using unconventional signal methods to gain control, inspired by John Draper's use of a toy whistle to access phone admin mode.
- **Parasitic EMF**: When current passes through a wire, it creates a magnetic and radio field, which can be used to transmit signals at audio frequencies.
- **Speaker playback**: By playing the right audio file through a speaker at a loud volume, it's possible to control the wheels and send lock and unlock signals.
- **Inconsistent results**: The Rocateq wheels didn't always respond, leading to further investigation.

**Reverse Engineering**
- **Scope**: The depth of investigation is limited by time and resources, requiring careful selection of areas to focus on.
- **Physical disassembly**: Purchased Rocateq wheels from eBay for destructive testing.
- **PCB analysis**: Front and back images overlaid to trace connections, revealing a programming header and a missing chip footprint.
- **Microcontroller**: PIC18F23K20, lacking 2.4GHz capability despite marketing claims.
- **Mystery chip**: Labeled N100B with DE4, possibly an accelerometer sensing motion to conserve battery power.
- **Unpopulated header**: May be intended for future 2.4GHz capability or advanced communications, but currently unused.

**Debugging and Logic Analysis**
- **PIC kit**: Used to connect to the microcontroller, revealing program memory, configuration bits, and EEPROM data.
- **Code protection**: None of the security bits were set, allowing code to be pulled off the microcontroller and analyzed with Ghidra.
- **Limited code**: Only about 2KB of actual code found, suggesting basic functionality and no encryption or data uploading/downloading.
- **Logic analyzer**: Used to capture signals during boot, revealing that the wheel only listens for signals when in motion, likely for battery saving.
- **Signal processing**: Passive components may be used for radio signal processing and basic mathematical operations to reduce processor load.

**Bypass Methods**
- **Per-check signal replay**: Play the per-check signal to the wheel to indicate payment and allow exit.
- **30-second disarm**: Bring the cart out, then back to the buried line within 30 seconds to re-enter the idle state.
- **Lock cycle**: Force the cart to lock and unlock with the appropriate signals, returning it to the idle state.

**Speculation**
- **2.4GHz capability**: FCC filings and marketing materials suggest 2.4GHz capability, but PCB analysis shows unpopulated components and no evidence of advanced communications.
- **Mystery chip**: Possibly an accelerometer for motion sensing, with ultra-low-power mode to conserve battery.
- **Unpopulated header**: May be intended for future expansion, but currently unused.
