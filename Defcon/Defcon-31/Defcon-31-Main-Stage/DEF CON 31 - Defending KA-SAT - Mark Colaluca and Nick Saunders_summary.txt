**Introduction**
- Speakers: Nick Saunders and Mark Colaluca, Viasat
- Topic: Defending KA-SAT, a cyberattack on Viasat's network in February 2022

**Attack Overview**
- **Two distinct attack vectors**:
    - **DHCP-based attacks**: Manipulated DHCP protocol and packets, causing a gradual decline in the number of modems online.
    - **Modem wiper event**: Affected 40,000-50,000 modems, leaving a long tail of modems trying to come back online and causing network instability.

**Network Architecture**
- **Customer Premise Equipment (CPE)**: End-user device that connects to the terminal/modem.
- **Terminal/Modem**: Interfaces with the CPE and the antenna, responsible for RF communication with the satellite.
- **Satellite**: Acts as a "big mirror," translating frequencies and beaming signals back down.
- **Ground Gateway System**: Converts RF signals into MAC layer, connecting to the core node.
- **Core Node**: Provides various services depending on the network, including control plane, management plane, and data plane functions.

**KASAT Network Layout**
- **Users**: Served by different partitions of the network, called Bandwidth Aggregation Points (BAPs).
- **BAP1 and BAP2**: Served regional sets of users, operated by a partner.
- **Viasat-operated Mobility Core**: A separate partition serving government and mobility customers.

**Investigation Process**
- **Initial Knowledge**: White and blinking blue LED lights on terminals indicated abnormal conditions.
- **Team Structure**: Dynamic teams formed based on the evolving situation, including analysis, reverse engineering, and network and infrastructure response teams.
- **Log Analysis**: Pulled logs from terminals, particularly focusing on early boot failure cases.

**Wiper Attack Investigation**
- **Terminal Acquisition**: Shipped terminals from Europe to Carlsbad labs, facing customs challenges.
- **Console and JTAG Analysis**: Modified terminals to connect through console and JTAG, dumped Flash content, and analyzed bootloaders and file systems.
- **Toolkit Discovery**: Found on a management server, containing scripts and binary files.

**Toolkit Reverse Engineering**
- **Key Questions**: What other capabilities did the toolkit have? Could it self-propagate? Could it be stopped?
- **Emulation and Detonation**: Used KMU emulation and sacrificial terminals to understand the toolkit's behavior and effects.
- **Conclusion**: Confirmed the toolkit's role in the wiper attack, with attackers leveraging compromised credentials and pivoting between servers.

**Control Plane Attacks**
- **Timeline**: Started around the same time as the wiper attack, causing a steep drop in the number of online terminals.
- **Preconditions**: Attackers must have valid access and identity within the network, with authenticated terminals and valid subscriptions.
- **Attack Decomposition**: Analyzed three variants of DHCP-based attacks and their impact on the DHCP server, VASN, and terminal connectivity.

**Defense Strategies**
- **Control Plane Filters**: Intervened to disable malicious DHCP requests.
- **Dedicated Control Plane Slice**: Created a Ukraine-only control plane slice to segment and protect the network.
- **RF Interference Mitigation**: Addressed eight different changes in RF interference, a complex and ongoing challenge.

**Conclusion and Request**
- Viasat's traditional bug bounty program is expanded to include over-the-air methods and attacks for disrupting a particular canary terminal.
- Researchers are invited to submit their resumes and portfolios for the Responsible Disclosure Program, with submissions opening in September.
