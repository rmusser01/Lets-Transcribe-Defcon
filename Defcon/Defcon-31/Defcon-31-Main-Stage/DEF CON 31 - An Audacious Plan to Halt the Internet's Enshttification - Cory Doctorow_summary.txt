**The Problem of Platform Enshittification:**
- Platforms mediate between **end users** and **business customers**.
- Initially, platforms are good to their users, but eventually, they abuse both users and business customers to **claw back value** for themselves.
- This leads to **platform decay** and an "inshittening."

**Case Study: Facebook:**
- Facebook started as a platform for ranking the **fuckability** of Harvard undergraduates.
- It promised users privacy and a personalized feed but later withdrew this surplus and allocated it to advertisers and publishers.
- Facebook exploited **high switching costs** and **network effects** to lock in users, advertisers, and publishers, creating a **hostage situation**.
- It then withdrew surplus from all groups, leaving just enough value to keep them stuck to the platform.

**Three Stages of Platform Inshittification:**
- Eliminate **competition** through **predatory pricing** and **acquisitions**.
- Use **universal computers** to **twiddle knobs** on the back end, altering deals without constraint.
- Criminalize **adversarial interoperability** through **IP laws**, preventing users from twiddling back.

**How to End Inshittification:**
- **Halt consolidation** and **break up big tech companies**.
- **Limit twiddling** by passing comprehensive **privacy laws** and ending **worker misclassification**.
- **Open up walled gardens** with **mandatory APIs** to restore low switching costs and enable interoperability.
- **Align tech giants' incentives** by restoring the right to mod, tinker, reverse, and hack services.
- **Block mergers** and **unwind existing ones**, restoring antitrust enforcement.

**The Role of Hackers:**
- Hackers can exploit **adversarial interoperability** to drain users and revenues from inshittified companies.
- They can also help keep interoperators honest by ensuring they are bound by **privacy**, **fair trading**, and **labor laws**.
- Hackers should spread good ideas and prepare for the next crisis to ensure it's not wasted.

**The Future of the Internet:**
- We can have a new good internet that is a worthy successor to the old one.
- It should be operated by and for the people who use it, with open, federatable, and hard-to-capture services.
- This requires limiting the power of tech giants and restoring our ability to twiddle back.
