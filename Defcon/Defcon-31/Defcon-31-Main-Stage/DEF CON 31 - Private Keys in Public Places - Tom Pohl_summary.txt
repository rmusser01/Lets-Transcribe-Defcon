**Introduction**
- Tom Pohl, a penetration testing team manager, presents his findings on private keys in public places.
- He emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about this issue, as it is often overlooked.

**Netgear Example**
- Tom and his friend, Nick Stark, discovered private keys and certificates in Netgear firmware.
- They found two CA-blessed certificates with associated private keys for routerlogin.net and funjsq.com.
- The issue was reported to Netgear, but they were unresponsive, leading to public disclosure and a fix within a week.

**Fortinet Example**
- Tom downloaded Fortinet software and discovered custom obfuscated archive files.
- He extracted the files and found Apple and Google-issued certificates with private keys used for push notifications.
- Fortinet acknowledged the issue and worked with Tom to address it, but the fix took over three years.
- Tom later discovered another private key in the firmware, potentially used for client authentication with their push notification proxy server.

**Dell Example**
- Tom's team conducted an internal penetration test and gained access to a mysterious device, which turned out to be a Dell Compellent connector.
- They found a properties file containing an encrypted vCenter password and a decompiled Java class file with a static AES key.
- Using the AES key, they decrypted the vCenter password and gained full admin access to the customer's vCenter.
- This access allowed them to create a domain admin account and download the NTDS.DIT file, compromising the entire network.
- Dell was notified and is working on a fix, but the storage platform is being deprecated, leaving customers vulnerable.

**Recommendations**
- Private keys should not be included in software binaries.
- Developers should undergo training to understand the importance of key management and the risks of including private keys.
- Coordinated disclosure programs should be adopted to ensure vendors fix vulnerabilities and don't use hush money to buy silence.
- Regular security audits and testing should be conducted to identify and eliminate this systemic practice.
