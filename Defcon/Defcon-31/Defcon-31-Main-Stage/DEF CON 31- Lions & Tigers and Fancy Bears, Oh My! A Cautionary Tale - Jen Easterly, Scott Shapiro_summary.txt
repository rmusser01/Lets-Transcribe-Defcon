**Introduction:**
- **Jen Easterly** (Director of CISA) and **Scott Shapiro** (Yale Law School Professor and author of *Fancy Bear Goes Phishing: The Dark History of the Information Age in Five Extraordinary Hacks*) discuss **cybercrime**, its history, and the future of **information security**.

**Hacking Greatest Hits:**
- **Morris Worm** (1988): Robert Morris Jr., a first-year graduate student, released a worm that crashed the internet. He was the first person convicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
- **Eastern Europe and the "Virus Factory":** The hacking epicenter shifted to Bulgaria in the early 1990s, with a focus on DOS viruses. The reputed best virus writer was **Dark Avenger**.
- **Paris Hilton's Cell Phone Hack** (2005): A 16-year-old boy from South Boston hacked into Paris Hilton's cell phone and leaked nude photos.
- **Fancy Bear Hack** (2016): The DNC was hacked, allegedly by Russian-backed hackers.
- **Mirai Botnet** (2016): A first-year undergraduate at Rutgers created a giant IoT botnet that crashed the internet, allegedly to get out of a calculus exam.

**The Evolution of Cyber Attacks:**
- There was a gap between the initial realization of the internet and the explosion of cyber attacks, including ransomware.
- Nation-states became increasingly involved in cyber conflicts, with the 2007 Russian-supported DDoS attack on Estonia as an early example.
- The **U.S. government's role** in cyber attacks, such as Stuxnet and WannaCry, accelerated the evolution of cyber warfare.

**Motivations and Behaviors:**
- Hacking can be categorized as **cybercrime**, **espionage**, or **war**, each with distinct motivations and threat models.
- **Cybercrime** is primarily motivated by financial gain and self-interest.
- **Espionage** is conducted by nation-states to collect information for national and economic security. It is legal under international law.
- The line between espionage and war is blurred when hacks are designed to disrupt digital systems rather than gather information.

**Cyber War and the Laws of War:**
- The traditional view of cyber attacks as an extension of kinetic weapons (e.g., bombs) is uninteresting.
- The fascinating aspect of cyber warfare is its ability to affect the **availability and integrity of information**, which challenges traditional laws of war focused on physical security.
- Shapiro argues that the laws of war should not be applied to cyber and suggests exploring other areas of international law, such as the norm of non-interference.

**Up-Code and Down-Code:**
- **Up-code** refers to the norms above your fingertips, including psychology, ethics, social rules, and the law.
- **Down-code** refers to the code below your fingertips, such as OS, firmware, and network protocols.
- The book initially focused on technical vulnerabilities (down-code) but shifted to exploring the incentives and norms (up-code) that lead to these vulnerabilities.
- Intervening at the up-code level is crucial to addressing the root causes of insecure technology.

**Insecure Internet and Software:**
- The internet was designed to be **insecure by design and default**, pushing security responsibilities to endpoints (OS and users).
- Software developers often prioritize sharing information over protecting it, leading to widespread vulnerabilities.
- To fix this, we need to provide the right incentives for developers to prioritize security, such as legal liability for negligently produced security vulnerabilities.

**The Role of the InfoSec Community:**
- The InfoSec community is key to saving the internet and technology through its ingenuity, creativity, and curiosity.
- The community's high standards, willingness to share knowledge, and interdisciplinary nature make it a valuable resource for society.
- By engaging with sociologists, anthropologists, lawyers, and others, the InfoSec community can lead the collective effort to create more secure technology.

**Solutionism and AI:**
- **Solutionism** is the belief that every social problem can be solved with technology (e.g., an app).
- Instead of relying solely on technology, we should focus on changing culture, education, and social norms to address social problems more effectively.
- The InfoSec community's credibility and expertise can play a crucial role in advocating for safe and ethical AI development.

**Final Thoughts:**
- The discussion ends with a lighthearted proposal for a "rock and roll village" at DEF CON, combining music and electronics hacking.
- Easterly thanks Shapiro for his participation and contributions to the field.
