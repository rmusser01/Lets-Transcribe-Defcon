**Introduction**
- **Alex**: Head of the Technical Department at Meduza, a Russian-speaking media outlet.
- **Meduza**: An independent, international media company that operates from exile, providing unbiased reporting on Russia and the war in Ukraine.
- **Presentation Topic**: How Meduza, as an exiled pirate media outlet, breaks through the Kremlin's propaganda firewall.

**Meduza's Background**
- Founded in 2014 by a group of journalists who wanted to create a free and independent media source.
- Operates from a safe haven in Latvia, with a decentralized leadership and funding structure.
- Adopts a pirate media approach: independent, self-sufficient, and expecting constant attacks and persecution.
- Uses simple language, memes, jokes, and swear words to appeal to a younger generation.
- Has a negative thinking mindset, always preparing for the worst-case scenario.

**Russia's Internet Censorship**
- Russia has become one of the most technically advanced countries in terms of internet censorship.
- They have installed Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) boxes everywhere, achieving a level of control similar to China's Great Firewall.
- The Russian government blocks tens of thousands of websites every month, targeting news media, circumvention tools, human rights, social networks, and file-sharing sites.
- They also block porn and alcohol sites, restricting access to information and entertainment for Russian citizens.
- Russia collaborates with other autocratic countries, exchanging knowledge and technology for censorship and surveillance.

**Meduza's Challenges and Strategies**
- Meduza has faced multiple attempts by the Russian government to block and censor their content.
- They have been outlawed in Russia, with anyone associated with Meduza facing jail time.
- Meduza employs a variety of strategies to circumvent censorship:
  - SOS communication: Providing readers with information on VPN services and alternative access methods before being blocked.
  - Mobile application: Integrating circumvention tools, peer-to-peer networking, automated mirror rotation, and light versions for poor connectivity.
  - Newsletter and PDF options: Offering alternative ways to access Meduza's content, including printing articles as PDFs.
  - Collaboration: Working with news aggregators, instant view in Telegram, and radio translations to spread their content.

**Future of Internet in Russia**
- Alex predicts that within a year, all Russians will be isolated from external information, creating an "Iron Curtain" effect.
- Global services that do not comply with Russian requirements will be replaced by Russian alternatives.
- Circumvention tools will become more difficult to access, and AI will be used to block content faster and more effectively.
- The future of the internet in Russia looks grim, with increasing censorship and control.

**Conclusion**
- Meduza, despite its small size and limited resources, remains inventive, creative, and dedicated to the freedom of information.
- They seek collaboration and support from individuals and companies who share their values to continue their fight against censorship.
- Alex encourages attendees to check out Meduza's website and spread the word about their work.
