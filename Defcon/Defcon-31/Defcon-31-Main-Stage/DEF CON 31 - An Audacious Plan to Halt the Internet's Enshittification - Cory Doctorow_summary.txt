**The Problem of Platform Inshittification:**
- Platforms mediate between **end users** and **business customers**.
- Initially, platforms are good to their users, but eventually, they abuse both users and business customers to **claw back value** for themselves.
- This leads to **mass end-stage platform decay**, or the "great inshittening."

**The Three Stages of Platform Inshittification:**
- **Stage 1**: Platforms allocate **surplus** (e.g., investor cash) to end users, locking them in with **network effects** and **high switching costs**.
- **Stage 2**: Platforms abuse end users to make things better for business customers (advertisers and publishers). They offer advertisers **fine-grained ad targeting** and publishers a **free traffic funnel**.
- **Stage 3**: Platforms withdraw surplus from everyone and hand it to **shareholders**, leaving just enough residual value to keep users and business customers stuck.

**Case Study: Facebook**
- Facebook started as a platform for ranking the **fuckability** of Harvard undergraduates.
- It lured users away from MySpace by promising privacy and a personalized feed.
- Facebook then withdrew the surplus from end users, allocating it to advertisers and publishers.
- For users, this meant a **dialed-down feed** filled with ads and boosted content.
- For advertisers, it meant **higher prices** and **less ad fraud policing**.
- For publishers, Facebook **suppressed reach** and **algorithmically punished** those who didn't post full-text feeds without links.

**The Final and Most Dangerous Phase of Inshittification:**
- Platforms want to withdraw all available surplus, leaving just enough value to keep users and business customers stuck.
- This is a **brittle equilibrium**, as users may bolt for the exits due to scandals, whistleblowers, or live-streamed mass shootings.
- **Network effects** become a double-edged sword: if users can't leave because everyone is staying, once everyone leaves, there's no reason to stay.

**Factors Contributing to Inshittification:**
- **Lack of Competition**: Antitrust enforcement has been weakened over the past 40 years, allowing companies to grow through **predatory pricing** and **acquisitions**.
- **Tech-Centric Factors**:
   - **Network effects** drive explosive growth.
   - **Low switching costs** driven by the universality of computers make it easy for competitors to plug into platforms through **adversarial interoperability**.
   - Tech companies have exploited weak antitrust rules to grow and then declared the **end of history**, criminalizing adversarial interoperability.

**The Policy Choices that Enable Inshittification:**
- **Consolidation**: Allowing companies to merge with competitors and buy out small ones eliminates competition, making it easier to treat customers and suppliers poorly.
- **Unrestricted Twiddling**: Tech companies can **twiddle the knobs** on the back end, altering the deal without explanation or transparency, due to weak privacy, labor, and fair trading laws.
- **Criminalizing Adversarial Interoperability**: Tech companies have secured changes to laws (e.g., DMCA, CFAA) that make it illegal for others to twiddle back at them, criminalizing adversarial interoperability.

**How to End Inshittification and Build a New Good Internet:**
- **Halt Consolidation and Break Up Big Tech**: The current U.S. administration is taking antitrust seriously, blocking mergers and demanding breakups.
- **Limit Twiddling**: Pass comprehensive **federal privacy laws** with a private right of action, end **worker misclassification** in the gig economy, and apply normal consumer protection standards to e-commerce platforms and search engines.
- **Open Up Walled Gardens**: Laws like the **Digital Markets Act** in the EU will force tech platforms to stand up **APIs** for interoperability.
- **Restore the Right to Mod and Tinker**: Roll back laws that constitute **felony contempt of business model** and restore the right to mod, tinker, reverse, and hack services to keep big companies from sabotaging mandatory interop.
- **Keep Interoperators Honest**: Apply the same **privacy, labor, and fair trading laws** to interoperators as to big tech companies to prevent abuse.

**Conclusion:**
- Inshittification is not inevitable, but it requires strong constraints on ordinary people to prevent it.
- By blocking mergers, limiting twiddling, opening up walled gardens, and restoring the right to mod, we can build a new good internet that is a worthy successor to the old one.
