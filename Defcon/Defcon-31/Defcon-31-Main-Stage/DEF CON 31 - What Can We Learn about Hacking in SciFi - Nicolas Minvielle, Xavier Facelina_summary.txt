**Introduction**
- **Xavier Facelina**: CEO of TechLab, securing critical systems including nuclear facilities.
- **Nicolas Minvielle**: Co-author, researcher at a university in France, CEO of his own company, leads the French Department of Defense's red team.
- The pair met at a conference and decided to collaborate on a research project exploring the links between science fiction and hacking.

**Science Fiction and Imagination**
- Science fiction is a **scientific domain** that influences and is influenced by innovation.
- It can be used to **shape innovation, politics, and regulations**, often through **dystopian** or **utopian** narratives.
- The **representation of hacking** in popular culture is often a **caricature**, which can impact the **legitimacy and credibility** of experts in the field.

**Hacking in Science Fiction vs Reality**
- Facelina and Minvielle's team analyzed **200 fictional attacks** and **800 real attacks** to compare their characteristics.
- In science fiction, attacks are more evenly distributed across **destroying, erasing, spying, and modifying** targets.
- In reality, **80% of attacks involve spying on government and financial data**.
- There is a **lag** between the appearance of hacking scenarios in science fiction and their realization in the real world.

**Examples of Physical Threats**
- **Nuclear Plant Hacking**: First appeared in science fiction in 1984, with the first real-world attack occurring in 2010 (Stuxnet).
- **Pacemaker Hacking**: First appeared in reality in 2008 with a scientific paper, followed by an episode in 2012 that influenced the removal of features from the US Vice President's pacemaker.

**Using Science Fiction for Innovation**
- Science fiction can be used to **identify macro tendencies**, such as the increase in **cyber attacks converting to real-world attacks**.
- It can also be used to **raise awareness, produce content, and innovate**.
- Example: Experimenting with **cartographic representations** of cyber threats, inspired by science fiction and other fields.

**Conclusion**
- The research project is ongoing, and the speakers invite interested parties to join their open research group to explore the topic further.
