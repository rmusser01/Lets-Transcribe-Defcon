**Introduction**
- Talk presented by **Alan Meekins** (NullAgent on social media) and Rekka Dam (absent)
- Focuses on **Bluetooth** technology and its use by law enforcement

**Law Enforcement Technology**
- Police officers carry various devices such as **tasers**, **body cams**, smartphones, and pistols
- Their vehicles are equipped with **Wi-Fi hotspots**, surveillance systems, and **dash cams** capable of **license plate reading**
- **Axon Signal** technology connects these devices, enabling data sharing and automatic recording activation

**Bluetooth Basics**
- Bluetooth devices send out **beacons** or **broadcasts** to pair with other devices
- Beacons contain parameters such as **MAC address**, manufacturer data, services, and local name
- **Gap fields** are additional optional fields
- Bluetooth devices can be **fingerprinted** based on the order of gap fields, manufacturer data, and MAC address

**Axon Signal in Depth**
- Axon Signal is a Bluetooth-enabled technology used by law enforcement
- It connects **body cams**, **tasers**, **pistol holsters**, **dash cams**, and **laptop dongles**
- When a taser is fired or a pistol is unholstered, a Bluetooth beacon is sent to trigger recording on body cams and dash cams
- Dash cams can also be activated by detecting police lights and sirens
- Axon, formerly Taser International, has an **OUI** (Organizationally Unique Identifier) of **0025DF**
- This OUI is used in the MAC addresses of their Bluetooth devices

**Bluetooth Broadcast Protocols**
- Some protocols rely entirely on broadcast capability without a direct connection
- Examples include **COVID exposure tracking**, **Apple Continuity**, and the upcoming **Drone ID**
- These protocols can impact personal privacy and trackability

**Detecting Axon Signal Devices**
- Wiggle.net and RF Party app can be used to detect and analyze Bluetooth devices
- Searching for Axon's OUI (0025DF) on Wiggle reveals locations of police departments and their Bluetooth devices
- RF Party can detect and track Bluetooth devices, simulating a "cop detector"

**Potential Applications**
- Proof of body cam: Using MAC addresses to compel law enforcement to release body cam footage
- Cop alerts: Creating alerts for specific cops or bad apples on the **Brady list**
- Surveillance monitoring: Understanding the prevalence of technologies like facial recognition and license plate readers

**Tools and Resources**
- **PDF viewer**, **OUI database**, **Wiggle.net**, and **NRF Connect** app
- **RF Party** app and open-source hardware for Bluetooth detection and analysis
- **Android** app available now, with Mac, Linux, and Windows versions coming soon
