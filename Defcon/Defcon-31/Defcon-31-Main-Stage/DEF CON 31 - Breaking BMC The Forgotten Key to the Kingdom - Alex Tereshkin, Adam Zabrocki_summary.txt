**Introduction**
- **NVIDIA**'s internal offensive security research team discovered several critical vulnerabilities in a **Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)** from an unnamed vendor.
- BMCs are specialized microcontrollers used in servers and enterprise-level hardware, providing remote management and control capabilities.
- The presentation will cover the team's journey from discovering the BMC to exploiting a series of vulnerabilities and gaining full control.

**BMC Overview**
- BMC is a **service processor** that monitors and controls hardware components in data centers, especially hosts.
- It offers remote access to various functions, such as **KVM** capabilities, BIOS configuration, and firmware updates, even when the device is powered off.
- BMCs are a **lucrative target** for attackers as compromising one can provide access to an entire data center.

**Initial Access**
- The team encountered a known **hash leak vulnerability** in the **IPMI** protocol used by the BMC, but needed a valid username to exploit it.
- They discovered a timing attack vulnerability in the username processing, allowing them to brute-force the correct username using a timing oracle.
- With the username and leaked hash, they were able to brute-force the password and gain initial access to the BMC.

**Exploring the BMC**
- The team wanted to understand the BMC's internal architecture, reverse-engineer the firmware, and identify additional vulnerabilities.
- They gained access to the host machine by exploiting the BMC's KVM capabilities and disabling secure boot.
- From the host, they located and extracted the BMC firmware image for further analysis.

**Vulnerabilities Discovered**
- The BMC firmware used an outdated and insecure **Redis** database to store user credentials, with encryption keys stored alongside encrypted passwords.
- They found multiple vulnerabilities in the IPMI server, including the ability to read and write arbitrary memory within the server process, enabling code execution.
- A feature allowing the download of arbitrary files from the BMC was found to have an insecure path construction vulnerability, leading to a **path traversal** issue.
- An **SNMP** configuration feature was discovered to be vulnerable to command injection, allowing arbitrary command execution on the BMC.
- Another feature for setting NTP servers had a shell injection vulnerability, providing another avenue for arbitrary command execution.
- The team also discovered the ability to perform arbitrary reads and writes to the host's SPI flash, enabling the installation of persistent implants.
- Finally, a critical pre-authentication remote stack overflow vulnerability was found in the telemetry functionality, allowing for potential remote code execution.

**Recommendations and Conclusions**
- The presentation highlights the critical nature of BMC security and the potential impact of compromising a single component.
- It emphasizes the lack of modern security mitigations and the need for secure coding practices, heavy fuzzing, and investment in security research to improve the overall state of BMC security.
- The team acknowledges the support of NVIDIA, the server team, and AMI in conducting this research and coordinating disclosures.
