**The Vulcan Files:**
- A cache of documents disclosed to German journalists, **Hakan Tanriverdi** and **Hannes Munzinger**, revealing Russian cyber operations.
- Involves a company called **NTC Vulcan**, owned and operated by Russian military veterans with authorization to work for Russian state organizations.
- Includes hundreds of pages of project documentation, contracting details, and more for various cyber tools and payloads.
- Three primary programs: **Scan-V**, **Amazit**, and **Crystal 2V**.

**Scan-V:**
- A distributed, multi-component system for automated cyber exploitation and infrastructure management.
- Combines external scanning, vulnerable software cataloging, and exploit deployment.
- Designed to increase efficiency and scale of cyber operations by identifying and exploiting endpoints, and setting up network intermediaries to launder traffic.
- Linked to Russian military intelligence **GRU** unit **74455** (Sandworm).

**Amazit:**
- An information operations and collection platform.
- Capable of capturing and manipulating communication streams, including social media platforms.
- Linked to the **Radio Research Institute** in Russia and the **Russian Federal Security Service (FSB)**.

**Crystal 2V:**
- A penetration testing platform for industrial control environments, similar to other Russian malware like **Triton** and **Indestroyer**.

**NTC Vulcan's Significance:**
- Provides insight into the "nuts and bolts" of Russian cyber operations.
- Demonstrates the privatization of cyber operations, with Russian cyber agencies outsourcing development and engineering to private companies.
- Links to various elements of Russian cyber operations, including GRU, FSB, and civilian intelligence agencies.

**Russian Cyber Operations History:**
- **VPNFilter** and **Cyclops Blink**: Network device-targeting capabilities used to compromise and rope in vulnerable infrastructure for proxying traffic.
- **SORM**: A system for domestic monitoring in Russia, requiring telco providers to install hardware for surveillance.

**Similar Programs in Other Countries:**
- **China's Great Firewall** and **Great Cannon**: Used for traffic control, interception, and exploitation payload delivery.
- **Snowden Leaks**: Included information on the **"Quantum"** program, which injected into traffic streams for exploitation.

**The Future of Offensive Cyber:**
- Greater automation and scalability, with a focus on codifying skills and capabilities.
- Emphasis on marshalling the neutral web for offensive actions, using vulnerable routers and devices as frontline articles.
- Less reliance on "rock star" hackers and more on commoditization of capabilities and AI applications.
- Networks will continue to be weaponized, creating challenges for defense and response.
