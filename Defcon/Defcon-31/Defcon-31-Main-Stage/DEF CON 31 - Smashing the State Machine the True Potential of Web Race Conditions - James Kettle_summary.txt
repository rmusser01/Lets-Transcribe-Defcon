**Introduction**
- The speaker begins by asking if the audience has ever encountered a vulnerability that seemed inexplicable.
- He then introduces the topic of web race conditions and how they can be exploited.

**Understanding Race Conditions**
- Race conditions occur when multiple conflicting inputs are fired at a website, causing its state machine to collapse.
- This can lead to the forging of trusted data, misrouting of tokens, and the creation of backdoors.
- Traditional race conditions focus on limit overruns, but there are other classes of race conditions with greater potential.

**The True Potential of Web Race Conditions**
- The speaker shares a personal experience where he almost missed a serious vulnerability due to failing to zoom in on the state machine.
- He emphasizes that race conditions can exist in any HTTP request, making everything potentially multi-step.

**Discovering Substates**
- To discover substates, a collision of two requests is needed: one to trigger the substate and another to access the same resource simultaneously.
- Network jitter, which randomly delays requests, is a major barrier to achieving this collision.

**The Single Packet Attack**
- The speaker introduces the single packet attack technique, which eliminates network jitter by fitting 20-30 HTTP requests into a single packet.
- This technique takes advantage of HTTP/2 and Nagle's algorithm to achieve high performance and ease of implementation.
- It has been released as an update to the open-source tool Turbo Intruder.

**Performance Benchmarking**
- The speaker presents benchmarking results comparing the single packet attack to the last byte synchronization technique.
- The single packet attack significantly reduces the median spread and standard deviation of request execution times.
- This makes remote race conditions local and improves the effectiveness of exploitation attempts.

**A Methodology for Finding Bugs**
- The speaker outlines a three-step methodology for finding race condition bugs: predict, probe, and prove.
- Prediction involves identifying potential collision points with serious consequences, while ruling out endpoints with less collision potential.
- Probing involves sending requests individually and then simultaneously to look for anomalies or clues of a substate.
- Proving involves understanding the behavior, replicating it, and exploring the impact.

**Case Studies**
- The speaker shares a case study on GitLab, where he discovered a vulnerability in the email invitation system.
- By sending multiple requests in a single packet, he was able to create multiple invitations with the same email address.
- He then demonstrates a live exploit, where he changes his email address multiple times in the same millisecond, causing a misrouting of confirmation tokens.

**Further Research and Exploitation**
- The speaker encourages further research into race conditions, highlighting the importance of spotting anomalies and understanding the root causes.
- He mentions partial construction attacks, unsafe combinations of data structures and locking strategies, and the impact of different session handlers.
- He also suggests exploring ways to improve the single packet attack and cause server-side delays.

**Defense and Prevention**
- The speaker offers defense advice, emphasizing the difficulty of predicting application behavior in the presence of race conditions.
- He suggests eliminating substates by making the effects of each request atomic and avoiding mixing data sources.
- Understanding the locking system used by the session handler is crucial for effective defense.

**Conclusion**
- The speaker summarizes the key takeaways: the single packet attack, the multi-step nature of race conditions, and the predict-probe-prove methodology.
- He encourages the audience to try out the techniques and tools mentioned and shares his contact information for further discussion.
