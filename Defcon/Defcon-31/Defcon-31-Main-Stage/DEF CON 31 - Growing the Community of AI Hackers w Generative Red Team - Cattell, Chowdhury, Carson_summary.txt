**Introduction**
- **Sven**: Mathematician who has wandered into security, founded the AI Village at DEF CON six or seven years ago.
- **Roman Chowdhury**: Previously on Twitter, now running Humane Intelligence, and led the design team.
- **Austin Carson**: Worked in Congress and the nonprofit world, teaching people in government about technology. Also worked at NVIDIA.

**The Need for Testing AI Systems**
- Traditional software is explainable and can be audited, but AI is often referred to as a **black box**.
- AI is more like **chaos**, where small changes can lead to unpredictable outcomes.
- It is impossible to test all possible inputs and attackers can exploit areas that haven't been tested.
- LLMs have a broad range of applications, so testing is crucial to ensure they don't cause harm.
- Patching LLMs is more complex and expensive than traditional software, so testing is essential.

**History and Motivation**
- The first reported ML vulnerability was in spam filtering in 2003.
- **Austin** and **Sven** met at Hackers on the Hill in February and discussed the idea of a generative AI red team.
- They turned an event at South by Southwest into a red team exercise, with students from Houston Community College.
- The White House decided to jointly announce and participate in the red team, attracting major companies.
- A second pilot was held at Howard University with students from Howard and Georgetown.

**Designing the Generative Red Team (GRT)**
- Led by **Raman**'s nonprofit, Humane Intelligence, in collaboration with NIST, OSTP, and various nonprofits and vendors.
- Aimed to align the GRT with the **AI Bill of Rights**, making it testable for important technologies.
- Two types of challenges: **prompt injections** (subverting security safeguards) and **embedded harms** (unintended consequences from good-faith use).
- Grading is challenging due to the complexity of interactions between LLMs and humans.
- An auto-grading system will be used, followed by human judges for the top submissions.

**Details of the GRT**
- A variety of models are included, ranging from 40 billion to 175 billion parameters.
- Some models have **defenses** (e.g., input and output filters, reinforcement learning from human feedback) while others are "naked."
- Participants are encouraged to test the models based on their unique backgrounds and expertise.
- A **point system** will be used to determine the winners, who will receive an NVIDIA A6000 GPU.

**Next Steps and Future Plans**
- A sister conference, CamLess, will host a live hacking event of a large remote language model in October.
- The top 10 finishers from the GRT will be invited to participate and given API keys for three days of testing.
- Coordinated issue disclosure will be done after DEF CON, with a complicated patching process expected to take six months.
- **Austin** emphasizes the importance of proving the value of white hat hackers in testing AI models and the need to find "weird stuff" that breaks them.
