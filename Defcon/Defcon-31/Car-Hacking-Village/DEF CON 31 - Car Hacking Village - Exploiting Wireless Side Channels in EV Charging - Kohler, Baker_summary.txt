**EV Security and Charging Standards**
- **Combined Charging System (CCS)**: One of the most widely-used DC rapid-charging technologies for EVs, vulnerable to wireless attacks.
- **Power-line Communication (PLC)**: CCS uses PLC, where the car and charger communicate during charging, exchanging information like maximum current/voltage and state of charge.
- **Security Concerns**: PLC signals can leak from the charging cable, acting as an unintentional antenna, allowing adversaries to inject their own signals with off-the-shelf radio equipment.
- **AutoCharge**: A system used by some networks that relies on identifiers that are fairly public, potentially enabling billing fraud.

**Passive Threat Model and Eavesdropping**
- **Signal Attenuation Characterization (SLAC)**: A system within CCS initialization that ensures the car and charger are communicating with the correct devices, but can be exploited to obtain network keys.
- **Experiment Setup**: Researchers used software-defined radio and antennas placed in various locations near charging vehicles to test signal reception.
- **Results**: Researchers successfully picked up signals and decoded messages containing unique identifiers (MAC addresses) and network keys, enabling potential billing fraud.

**Active Attacks and Injection**
- **Broken Wire**: The name of the vulnerability discovered, exploiting the CSMA-CA mechanism used by HomePlug GreenPhi.
- **CSMA-CA**: Mechanism ensuring that only one device transmits at a time by detecting preambles 2dB above noise. Attackers can disrupt charging by transmitting a signal to make the channel appear busy.
- **Lab Experiments**: Researchers successfully disrupted charging communication with low power output (<10mW) from a distance of 10 meters, even between floors.
- **Real-world Testing**: Experiments with various vehicles and charging stations confirmed the vulnerability, with successful disruption from up to 50 meters away.

**Mitigation and Future Standards**
- **Shielding**: Adding shielding to charging cables can help reduce signal leakage, but it also increases stiffness and weight, and higher power amplification can still overcome shielding.
- **Firmware Upgrade**: Updating the firmware of the Qualcomm chip could potentially address the vulnerability, but it's unclear if the issue is hardware or firmware-related.
- **Megawatt Charging System (MCS)**: A new standard using differential PLC, which may improve EMC compatibility, but further testing is needed to assess its security.
- **North American Charging Standard (NACS)**: Adopts PLC communication, potentially inheriting similar vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion**
- CCS is vulnerable to wireless attacks, allowing eavesdropping and disruption of charging.
- PLC technology may not be suitable for critical communications in EV charging infrastructure.
- Shielding and firmware upgrades can help, but comprehensive security measures are needed for future charging standards.
