**Introduction**
- Speakers: Ian Tabor and Dr. Ken Tindall
- Tabor's car was stolen by a method he discovered in another vehicle
- Tindall is a veteran in the automotive industry, with experience dating back to 1995
- He has worked on various projects, including the design of the **CAN** protocol and security systems

**Tindall's Background**
- Co-founder of **Canis Labs**, a **CAN** bus security company
- Designed **CANHG**, a protocol to speed up **CAN**
- Developed **CryptoCAN**, a system for encrypting **CAN** frames
- Currently working on **CAN** security standards with the **CAN in Automation** group

**Tabor's Car Hacking Experience**
- In 2015, he discovered security vulnerabilities in a **Citroen DS5** that allowed access to the vehicle's systems via a **Wi-Fi** connection
- Despite reporting the issue to the manufacturer, no recall was issued, and the vulnerability remained unpatched for several versions
- In 2018, he presented his findings at **DEF CON 26** Car Hacking Village, including the disclosure process and how the issue was eventually fixed
- Tabor has also successfully hacked other vehicles, including one in under 90 seconds, demonstrating the seriousness of the security issues

**Theft of Tabor's Car**
- In April 2022, Tabor noticed signs of vandalism on his car, but didn't suspect an attempted theft
- A few months later, in July, his car was stolen
- He received notifications on the **My Toyota** app, indicating that the car was in motion and the fuel gauge was at 50%, but couldn't track its location
- The police and Toyota were unable to help, and the car was never recovered

**Investigation and Findings**
- Tabor's investigation led him to discover a device that is plugged into the **CAN** bus in the headlight wiring, allowing thieves to unlock and start the car
- The device is disguised as a **JBL** speaker with additional electronics inside
- It is sold as an emergency start device, but its real purpose is car theft
- The device works by injecting **CAN** frames and using a modified transceiver to prevent other **ECUs** from communicating
- It is effective on various Toyota and Lexus models, with a wide range of vehicles potentially vulnerable

**Bench Testing and Technical Details**
- The device overrides the **CAN** transceiver, forcing a recessive state on the bus
- This prevents other **ECUs** from transmitting dominant bits, allowing the device to spoof **CAN** frames
- The custom **CAN** transceiver circuit breaks protocols and pushes weird voltages onto the bus, which other transceivers interpret as valid **CAN** frames
- This method bypasses hardware security approaches like **NXP Stinger** and **CANHG**
- The vulnerability lies in the **CAN** bus connection to the headlight, which allows access to critical systems such as the smart key **ECU** and the immobilizer

**Media Coverage and Industry Impact**
- Tabor's blog post on the theft and his findings received significant attention, with over 330,000 views
- Media reports often focused on "headlight hacking," but the issue is with the headlight wire, not the headlight itself
- The vulnerability has been linked to the theft of multiple vehicles, including **Toyota RAV4** and **Lexus** models
- Industry reports and organizations have recognized the seriousness of the issue, and a **CVE** has been issued

**Disclosure Process and Potential Fixes**
- Tabor and Tindall have faced challenges in the disclosure process, with Toyota directing them to their vulnerability disclosure program, **Hacker One**
- They propose two potential fixes: a quick-and-dirty short-term fix involving making the gateway paranoid about **CAN** bus errors at startup, and a permanent fix using cryptographic messaging and encryption solutions like **CryptoCAN** or **SECOC**
- Tabor also highlights the need for car manufacturers to address security issues in existing vehicles, not just future models

**Conclusion**
- Tabor and Tindall's presentation provides a detailed account of the theft of Tabor's car and the subsequent investigation
- It highlights the seriousness of automotive security vulnerabilities and the need for effective disclosure processes and fixes
- The proposed solutions offer potential ways to address the issue, but the speakers emphasize the importance of industry-wide action to protect vehicles and their owners from theft.
