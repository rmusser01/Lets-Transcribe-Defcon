**Introduction**
- Presented by Packet Hacking Village
- Speaker: Pete Hay, Principal Security Strategist at SimSpace and founder of The Cyber Report

**Topic: The Importance of Arts and Crafts in ThreatOps**
- Arts and crafts refer to the visual representation of complex cybersecurity concepts.
- Effective diagrams are essential for conveying information in a simple yet information-dense manner.

**Challenges in Cybersecurity Visualizations**
- Inconsistency: Different analysts may create divergent diagrams for the same incident.
- Lack of Standardization: Diagrams often focus on a single domain, making it difficult to compare and contrast different reports.
- Poor Utilization of Space: Some diagrams fail to utilize the X and Y axes effectively, reducing their informational value.

**Proposed Solution: The Threat Matrix**
- Aims to provide a tool for effective visualization, not a universal standard.
- Uses two axes: a timeline (X-axis) and artifact planes (Y-axis).
- Timeline: Sequences behaviors and tactics, providing a clear understanding of the attack flow.
- Artifact Planes: Clusters artifacts based on their location (e.g., host, network, internal/external).

**Using the Threat Matrix**
- Nodes: Represent specific entities such as files, hosts, endpoints, emails, etc.
- Connections: Indicate relationships between nodes, e.g., a process communicating with an endpoint.
- Use Cases: Can be applied to threat intelligence, incident response, and executive briefings.

**Demonstration: Royal Ransomware**
- Uses a timeline to show the sequence of events, from phishing to encryption.
- Identifies key points of coalescence, such as the deletion of shadow files, for potential defenses.
- Provides detailed function-level analysis, allowing for specific detection and response actions.

**Demonstration: Euro Trooper Campaign**
- Visualizes the entire campaign, from phishing email to APT-like behavior.
- Identifies a single point of dependency (link files and MISHTA) for potential defensive strategies.
- Emphasizes the value of understanding campaign behavior rather than relying solely on IOCs.

**Demonstration: New Attack on Ukraine and Poland**
- Based on a recent Talos report, showcasing the ability to visualize incomplete threat intelligence.
- Highlights the use of link files and the importance of preventing specific behaviors (e.g., Mishta touching the internet).
- Provides a defense strategy by targeting the campaign's dependencies.

**Incident Response with the Threat Matrix**
- Allows for bidirectional analysis: moving backward to source or forward to scope effects.
- Provides a visual medium for collaboration, coordination, and knowledge management during incident response.
- Facilitates prioritization and delegation of tasks among analysts.

**Conclusion**
- The threat matrix offers a tool for effective visualization and knowledge management in cybersecurity.
- It aids in threat intelligence consumption, incident response, and executive briefings.
- By providing a clear and information-dense representation, it enhances collaboration and defense strategies.
