**Introduction**
- Will is from Australia and works in cyber security
- This talk is about seeking people's personal information online
- Will had no prior experience in coding, social engineering, or data science
- The idea for this talk came from the Wall of Sheep at DEF CON, a village that shows what people are leaking on an unsecure network

**Wall of Sheep Online Edition**
- Will's goal was to find and present people's personal information leaked online, similar to the Wall of Sheep
- He wanted to focus on the DEF CON community and social media platforms they use, such as Reddit, Discord, and forums
- Will had to define what constitutes a leak and learn reconnaissance techniques

**Personal Information and Vulnerability**
- **PII** (Personal Identifiable Information) includes name, date of birth, and social security number
- **PVI** (Personal Vulnerability Information) refers to vulnerable personal traits or leverageable information that can be used to target an individual
- Examples of PVI include language use, personality types, and life situations
- Malicious actors, including APTs, hacktivists, stalkers, and child predators, use PVI to identify and target victims

**Finding and Monitoring Targets**
- Will used a combination of CIA methods, military concepts, and intrusion kill chain to identify and select targets
- He chose the DEF CON subreddit as his initial target, assuming that users who reveal information there will also reveal elsewhere
- Will searched for specific keywords and phrases related to personal information and vulnerability
- He used GPT to enhance his search by generating a list of words and phrases that indicate potential leaks

**Data Sources and Tools**
- Will initially used a website called PushShift.io to query Reddit data, but it stopped working halfway through his research
- He then discovered a text file containing all Reddit comments, allowing him to search using Python
- Will also utilized the Australian government's security clearance attributes and their antonyms to identify potential targets
- He asked GPT to generate variations of sentences indicating vulnerable traits and searched for them in the text file

**Target Assessment**
- Will assessed the impact and frequency of leaks, considering the accumulative effect of multiple small leaks
- He manually reviewed the results to validate and prioritize targets, focusing on high-quantity packs
- Will also considered the target's threat model, privacy, and potential for manipulation or attack

**Case Studies**
- Will presents several case studies of targets who revealed personal information, including email addresses, drug use, device information, and conspiratorial beliefs
- One target revealed their name, age, location, and backstory, providing a pathway for building rapport or targeting
- Another target revealed their vehicle description, including decals and stickers, making it easy to identify and target them
- A military target revealed their rank, career goals, grievances, and workplace, providing an attacker with valuable information

**Conclusion**
- Will emphasizes that the barriers to entry for online targeting have been removed with the advancement of technology
- Anyone can now conduct online targeting with no prior experience, using tools like GPT and publicly available data
- He encourages the audience to reflect on their own social media presence and consider the accumulated vulnerability they may be exposing
