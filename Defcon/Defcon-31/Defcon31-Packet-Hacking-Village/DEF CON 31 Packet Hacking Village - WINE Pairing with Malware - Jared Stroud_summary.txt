**Introduction**
- **Jared Stroud**: Security Lead at the MITRE Corporation and adjunct lecturer at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
- **Topic**: Using WINE (Windows emulator) for malware analysis and red teaming.

**WINE Overview**
- **WINE**: A recursive acronym for "WINE Is Not an Emulator", used to run Windows applications on Linux.
- **Advantages**: Open-source, actively maintained, and allows for easy extraction of initial indicators of compromise (IoCs) without expensive sandboxes.
- **Use Cases**: Facilitates both offensive and defensive security workflows.

**Malware Analysis with WINE**
- **Motivation**: Streamlining the process of analyzing large batches of malware samples by reducing infrastructure overhead.
- **WINE Benefits**: Provides access to initial artifacts like DNS requests, outbound TCP/UDP data, and host-based artifacts without managing complex virtualization setups.
- **WINE Prefix**: Acts as a wrapper for the C drive, allowing easy access to files and registry keys created/modified by malware.
- **DLLs**: The real magic lies in custom DLLs, enabling dynamic instrumentation of API calls and data capture during malware execution.

**Red Teaming with WINE**
- **Benefits**: Shortens the offensive development lifecycle by providing faster feedback loops and easier adoption of software engineering practices.
- **Containerization**: Demonstrates how to scale malware execution using Docker and Kubernetes, simplifying the process of handling large numbers of samples.
- **Shellcode Runners**: WINE allows for easier integration and repeatability when testing new frameworks or techniques, without the need for Windows VMs.
- **Beacon Object Files (BOFs)**: WINE enables testing and debugging of BOFs, which are challenging to write and prone to crashes, by providing a feedback loop for development and testing.

**Limitations and Challenges**
- **Kernel Land**: Direct syscalls and certain API call implementations may not work as expected, requiring deeper investigation into source code.
- **AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface)**: Always returns "no malware found", indicating a potential fuzzing target or area for further exploration.
- **Sandboxing**: WINE does not provide sandboxing capabilities, requiring dedicated machines for malware execution and isolation.
- **Detection and Evasion**: Malware can detect WINE-specific artifacts and process names, impacting its behavior or revealing its presence.

**Takeaways**
- WINE can execute trending malware in 2023, including Cobalt Strike and Metasploit payloads.
- Custom DLLs enable additional instrumentation and data capture during malware execution.
- WINE shortens the red teaming testing cycle by providing faster feedback loops and easier integration with CI/CD workflows.
- WINE is not a replacement for Windows VMs but offers a useful alternative for initial proof-of-concept testing and shellcode runner adoption.
