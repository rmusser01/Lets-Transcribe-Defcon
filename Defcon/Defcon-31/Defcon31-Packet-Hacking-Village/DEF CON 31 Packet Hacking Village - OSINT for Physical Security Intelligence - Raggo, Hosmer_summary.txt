**Introduction**:
- **DEF CON 31** talk presented by the **Packet Hacking Village**
- Speakers: **Mike Rago** and **Chet Hosmer**

**OSINT for Physical Threat Intelligence**:
- **Open-source intelligence (OSINT)**: Collecting curated data to eliminate time spent on preliminary data analysis
- Focus on **physical threat intelligence**: Applying OSINT to real-world situations, such as business risk, disaster response, and geopolitical events
- **Data sources**: Social media, Discord servers/channels, etc.
- Understanding the **chemistry** of different social networks and mediums

**Tradecraft**:
- Emphasizing **less data, not more**: Collecting information by geo (ground truth) rather than keywords/hashtags
- Respecting **terms of service** and privacy policies of different websites and social networks
- Leveraging exposed **APIs** and understanding their tiers and limitations

**Data Collection and Analysis**:
- Python script for data collection by geo: Selecting a city/location, defining a bounding box/radius, and/or providing latitude/longitude
- Collecting posts, images, videos, and emojis from within the specified geo area
- Profiling and categorizing accounts: Identifying top posters with legitimate information and those spreading misinformation
- Using **optical character recognition (OCR)** and **computer vision** to scan images and videos for serial numbers, locations, etc.

**Visualizing and Interpreting Data**:
- Plotting data on **maps** (e.g., Google Maps) to track movements and identify patterns
- Using dashboards and tools (e.g., Power BI, Grafana) for data sorting, filtering, and visualization
- Leveraging **AI** and **prompt engineering** (e.g., Chat GPT, Copilot) for data interpretation and dashboard creation

**Case Study: Ukraine-Russia War**:
- Tracking military equipment and troop movements by identifying serial numbers and locations
- Uncovering a narrative: Destruction of places of worship (churches, synagogues, mosques) during the war
- Predicting future targets by analyzing data chronologically and locationally

**Other Applications**:
- **Disaster response**: Monitoring natural disasters, identifying affected areas, and mobilizing help
- **Account profiling**: Focusing on top posters and excluding accounts spreading misinformation
- **Extrapolation and prediction**: Using data to make informed predictions and decisions

**Conclusion**:
- OSINT can be applied to various situations, providing timely and actionable intelligence
- Emphasizing curated data by geo and leveraging automation and AI enhances analysis and prediction capabilities
