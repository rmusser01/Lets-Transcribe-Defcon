**Introduction**
- DEF CON 31 talk by D-9, a retired colonel and independent AI and cyber researcher.
- Focuses on taking an **offensive stance** as a **cyber defender** by leveraging **cyber psychology** and **AI**.

**Overview of the Approach**
- Understanding the **human behavior** of **attackers** and manipulating their **decision-making process**.
- **Cyber psychology**: A new field studying the human behavior of attackers and how it can be used to manipulate them.
- **Cognitive human bias**: Subconscious decision-making process that can reveal vulnerabilities.
- **Bias sensors and triggers**: Used to detect and exploit cognitive vulnerabilities in attackers.

**Theoretical Framework**
- **Three separate minds** involved in decision-making: autonomous, algorithmic, and reflective.
- **Autonomous mind**: Responsible for **rote tasks** and **emotional responses**.
- **Algorithmic mind**: Capable of **logical reasoning** and **overriding** the autonomous mind.
- **Reflective mind**: Influences **beliefs** and **opinions**, and allows for **critical thinking**.
- **Cognitive miser**: Tendency to take **mental shortcuts** to avoid exerting too much effort in decision-making.
- **Mind-ware contamination**: Manipulating beliefs and understandings to influence reflective mind decision-making.
- **Mind-ware gaps**: Decision-making based on **incomplete knowledge** or **understanding**.

**Applying the Framework**
- **Recon and Scan Phase**: Lure attackers by planting **known vulnerabilities** or **honeypots** that exploit their **generalized biases**.
- **Obstacle Course**: A series of **part-task exercises** to identify specific **cognitive vulnerabilities** of the attacker.
- **Cyber Psychology Informed Defenses**: Combination of **sensors and triggers** used to manipulate the attacker's behavior.
- **Hyper Games**: Exploiting the attacker's **incomplete understanding** of the game strategies.
- **System Overview**: A tool that uses **AI** and a **game engine** to control and manipulate the attacker's actions.

**Operationalizing the Concept**
- **Intrusion Tokens**: Used to detect an attacker's presence and trigger the obstacle course.
- **Channeling Techniques**: Guide attackers towards specific areas of the network based on their identified vulnerabilities.
- **Data Poisoning**: Providing attackers with **realistic but false data** to exfiltrate and analyze.
- **Garbage File Exfiltration**: Allowing attackers to access real data but redirecting their exfiltration attempts to a garbage file.
- **Defensive Display**: A visual representation of the attacker's actions for defenders to monitor and intervene if needed.

**Discussion and Q&A**
- **Applicability**: The approach may need tweaking for organizations without specific targets like APTs.
- **Intuition vs. Science**: The importance of using scientific models and algorithms over intuitive social engineering.
- **Countering the Approach**: Once attackers are aware of the game, their biases and behaviors may change, requiring more sophisticated tactics.
- **Community Collaboration**: Exploring the potential for an open-source project to develop effective defensive tools.

**Conclusion**
- The talk presents an early R&D concept that requires further human experimentation and refinement.
- By understanding cyber psychology and exploiting cognitive biases, defenders can take an offensive stance and impose cyber penalties on attackers.
