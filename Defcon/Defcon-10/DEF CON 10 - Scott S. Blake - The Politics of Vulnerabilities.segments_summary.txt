- Introduction: Scott Blake, VP of Information Security at Bindview Corporation, introduces the topic of the politics of vulnerabilities and how it affects information security. He defines politics as the study of power and its various forms, including economic, social, cultural, and military power.
- Definitions: Blake defines a vulnerability as a flaw in software or misconfiguration that can be exploited. He also defines key terms such as "actor," "ideology," "legitimacy," and "authority."
- Ideologies: Blake discusses three main ideologies related to vulnerability disclosure: full disclosure, responsible disclosure, and zero disclosure. Full disclosure advocates believe that information should be freely shared to improve security, while responsible disclosure advocates withhold exploit code to prevent misuse. Zero disclosure limits vulnerability information to the software vendor.
- Actors: Blake identifies six categories of actors in the vulnerability landscape: vendors, researchers, the underground, governments, media, and the public. He highlights their motivations, interests, and power relations.
- Policy Initiatives: Blake reviews various policy initiatives, such as the Council of Europe's Cybercrime Treaty, information sharing policies, disclosure forums, and legislation related to FOIA, antitrust, and DMCA. He predicts that legislation will continue to focus on improving cybercrime definitions and communication channels.
- Trends and Predictions: Blake expects an increase in legislation, communication channels, security research, and software vulnerabilities. He predicts more vicious and multi-platform attacks, and discusses the possibility of the public demanding security and privacy.
- Wrap-up: Blake concludes that while software engineering is improving, increasing complexity offsets these gains. He emphasizes the importance of viewing security as a process rather than a product and encourages further discussion on the topic.
