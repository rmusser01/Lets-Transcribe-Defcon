- Bastille Linux is a security hardening script for Linux and Unix, currently supporting Red Hat, Mandrake, Turbo Linux, SuSE, Debian, and HP-UX.
- Hardening scripts improve security by disabling unnecessary features and tightening configurations.
- The script includes a firewall, set UID audit, file permissions audit, account security enhancements, and more.
- Hardening is effective against attacks by knowledgeable hackers, script kiddies, and worms.
- Bastille works by minimizing points of entry, removing attack vectors, and educating users and sysadmins.
- It can be used to protect against vulnerabilities in Red Hat 6.0, such as those in Bind, Woo FTPD, and Sendmail.
- The script is customizable and can be reused on multiple systems with identical configurations.
- Future plans include support for more operating systems, improved GUI, and additional hardening steps.
- Similar tools exist, such as Titan, but Bastille aims to provide an easy-to-use and comprehensive solution.
