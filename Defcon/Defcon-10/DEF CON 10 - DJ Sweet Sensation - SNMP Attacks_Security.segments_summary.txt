- # SNMP Protocol Breakdown
- ## Introduction to SNMP
- SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a protocol for collecting and organising information about managed devices on IP networks. 
- SNMP has been around since the 1980s and there have been three significant versions of the protocol: SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3. 
- SNMP is widely used in network management for network monitoring. 
- SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems, which are organised in a Management Information Base (MIB). 
- ## SNMP Operations
- SNMP supports four types of operations: Get, Set, Walk, and Trap. 
- Get and Set are used to retrieve and change the value of variables, respectively. 
- Walk is used to discover available variables and their values. 
- Trap is used for asynchronous notification from agent to manager. 
- ## SNMP Security
- SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c use community strings for authentication, which are often left as their default values ("public" for read-only access and "private" for read-write access). 
- SNMPv3 offers improved security through authentication and encryption. 
- ## SNMP Tools
- SNMP tools mentioned include Net-SNMP, PakDefConX MIB, and PakDefConX Source Code. 
- ## SNMP and Tripwire
- SNMP can be used as a replacement for Tripwire, a host-based intrusion detection software. 
- SNMP can be used to automate remote hash gathering and set up escalation and alarms based on changes in data. 
- ## SNMP and Other Protocols
- SNMP is compared to other protocols, including TCP, UDP, OSI Connectionless-mode Network Service (CLNS), AppleTalk Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP), and Novell Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX). 
- SNMP is also compared to Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP).
