    <item>Background: Linux Intrusion Detection System (LIDS) aims to protect Linux kernel from attacks and enhance security. LIDS has been in development for ~3 years with contributions from various developers.</item>
    <item>Architecture: LIDS consists of access control models, database, administration interface, and hook checking. It patches the Linux kernel and implements a trusted kernel with mandatory access control (MAC).</item>
    <item>Implementation: LIDS includes structures like "secure" (global access control list), and per-process access control lists (ACLs) in the task structure. It intercepts system calls like "chmod" to enforce access controls.</item>
    <item>Attack and Defense: LIDS defends against attacks on superuser privileges, Trojan horses, kernel modifications, malicious code injection, and shellcode. It uses file system protection, capability controls, and shellcode detection to prevent unauthorized access and modifications.</item>
    <item>Building Secure Linux with LIDS: LIDS requires a vanilla kernel and LIDS patch. It can be configured and built with make menu config. Leads.org provides tools, configuration files, and documentation for setting up and administering LIDS.</item>
    <item>Summary: LIDS is a free software project under GPL. It enhances Linux kernel security by providing attack detection and defense mechanisms. The speaker acknowledges the contributions of the LIDS community and the benefits of free software.</item>
