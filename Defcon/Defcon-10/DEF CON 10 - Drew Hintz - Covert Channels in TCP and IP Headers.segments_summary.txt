- Introduction: The presenter will discuss covert channels and TCP/IP headers, including their use cases, detection, and prevention.
- Use Cases: Covert channels can be used to communicate secretly with a host or hide the fact that communication is taking place. This may be necessary when encryption is restricted or to avoid key escrow. It can also be useful for evading surveillance by adversaries such as network administrators or governments.
- Adversaries: The presenter distinguishes between casual and dedicated observers, noting that dedicated observers have more resources and motivation to detect covert channels.
- Covert Channel Types: The presenter defines two types of covert channels: extra information channels, which send hidden messages within normal communication, and hidden path channels, which obscure the fact that communication is taking place between two parties.
- Extra Information Channels: These channels exploit randomness in normal network traffic, such as TCP sequence numbers or timing, to encode hidden messages.
- Hidden Path Channels: These channels use intermediary nodes to relay messages, making it difficult to trace communication back to the sender. Techniques include mixes, onion routing, and exploiting network performance.
- Covert Channel Properties: The presenter discusses factors to consider when evaluating a covert channel, including bandwidth, ease of detection and prevention, permissibility, and implementation difficulty.
- TCP/IP Header Covert Channels: The presenter focuses on covert channels within TCP/IP headers, including the urgent pointer, padding, reserved bits, IP type of service, and initial sequence number. Each channel's bandwidth, detection difficulty, prevention methods, and implementation considerations are discussed.
- Detection and Prevention: The presenter outlines methods for detecting and preventing covert channels, such as analyzing network traffic for anomalies, normalizing traffic, and using packet pumps to disrupt timing-based channels.
- Implementation Issues: The presenter highlights the importance of encryption, data indexing, and reliability versus bandwidth trade-offs in implementing covert channels.
- Tool Demonstration: The presenter introduces a tool for sending and receiving covert data using various TCP/IP header channels. The tool includes options for data indexing and encryption, and future improvements are discussed.
- Open Source Vulnerability Database: The presenter promotes a new community-driven vulnerability database project.
