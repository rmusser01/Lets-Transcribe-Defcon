- Introduction: Walter Dougherty, a computer science professor at Texas A&M University, presents on quantum computing and its application in cracking RSA encryption.
- Quantum Computing: Quantum is a significant unit or step in science, and quantum mechanics has been a widely accepted theory for 75 years. Quantum computing involves various interdisciplinary fields such as physics, computer science, mathematics, chemistry, and RF electronics.
- Hilbert Space: A complex linear vector space used to mathematically describe quantum states, with eigenstates conventionally labeled as "zero" and "one" with specific brackets.
- Superposition: The ability of quantum particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously, represented as vector sums of eigenstates with complex number coefficients. These amplitudes are squared to obtain probabilities, which can sometimes be negative, leading to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.
- Entanglement: Describes two mutually dependent qubits with a joint state, where observing one qubit determines the state of the other. This concept is analogous to a teeter-totter or wearing mismatched socks.
- Quantum Operators: Analogous to logic gates but are reversible. A small set of universal operators, such as the controlled NOT, can generate all possible quantum logic functions.
- Exponential Speedup: Quantum bits (qubits) can hold 2^n values in superposition, allowing simultaneous calculations. A single operation on a superimposed register computes all 2^n values, providing an exponential speedup over classical computers.
- Cryptography: Conventional encryption uses symmetric keys, while public-key cryptography allows for secure key distribution. RSA encryption relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers and recommends key lengths of 1024 or 2048 bits for security.
- Quantum Computing and RSA: Quantum computers can crack RSA encryption by factoring large numbers efficiently using Shor's algorithm, which involves choosing a random number and calculating a table of modular exponentiation. The discrete Fourier transform is then applied to determine the period, from which the factors can be calculated.
- Crystal Ball Predictions: Quantum effect memory, where each bit is stored on a single electron, is expected within 5-10 years. Special-purpose experimental quantum computers will emerge, and commercial availability may follow in the future.
- Schrödinger's Cat: A thought experiment illustrating the concept of superposition, where a cat in a box is both dead and alive until observed, at which point its state collapses to a definite outcome.
