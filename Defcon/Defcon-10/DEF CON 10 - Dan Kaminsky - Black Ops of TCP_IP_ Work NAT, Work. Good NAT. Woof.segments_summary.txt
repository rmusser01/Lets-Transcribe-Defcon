- Instant Port Scanning: It is possible to discover open ports and available services on a network instantly, even on a large network. This can be done securely and statelessly by sending packets from a single local port and sniffing for responses. Challenges like spoofed responses and state management can be addressed using techniques like SYN cookies and cryptographic signatures.
- Gorilla Multicast: It is possible to send a single packet to multiple recipients on the current multicast-free internet. This can be achieved by linking a unicast IP to a broadcast MAC address, recontextualizing layer 2 and layer 3. Responses will be broadcasted within the subnet, allowing multiple listeners to cooperate without the sender knowing.
- NAT (Network Address Translation): NAT allows multiple hosts to share a globally addressable IP address by translating local IPs. This can be done without breaking end-to-end packet integrity by storing the original IP and Ethernet source addresses, and using MAC address translation. Stateless NAT is also possible using IP timestamps, which provide a way to embed additional data in packets without firewalls modifying it.
- Incoming Connectivity: It is possible to establish incoming connections to hosts behind NAT by using techniques like stateless scanning of the network and heuristics to prioritize responses. A stateful approach is necessary for stream management.
- TCP Splicing: It is possible to establish a TCP connection between two hosts behind NAT firewalls that only allow outgoing connections. This can be achieved by manipulating the layers and using a connection broker to synchronize and achieve port and sequence number convergence. TTL (Time to Live) manipulation and source routing can also be used to facilitate the connection.
- Firewall Analysis: Firewall behavior and NAT translation patterns can be discovered using TTL-based techniques and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) errors. OpenBSD firewalls may rewrite ICMP data, requiring alternative approaches.
- Attack Vector: By forging data streams that appear to come from any IP, an attacker can exploit stateful connections and inject data into a network. This can be done using TTL-limited connections, a connection broker, and spoofed packets.
