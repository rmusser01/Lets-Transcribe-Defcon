- Secure wireless networking and building secure 802.11 networks are the main topics of discussion.
- A small number of attendees have deployed 802.11 networks and even fewer use 802.1X or web authentication.
- Basic wireless technologies such as 802.11b, 802.11a, and 802.11g are introduced, with the latter two being equivalent to 802.11b in terms of performance.
- Bluetooth is mentioned as a less useful technology for real networking, except for wireless earpieces.
- 802.11b is widely available, cheap, and well-supported, but has limited range and speed due to protocol overhead and retransmissions.
- 802.11a and 802.11g offer higher bandwidth but are vulnerable to signal obstruction by trees and buildings.
- Wireless security measures such as WEP (Wireless Equivalent Privacy) and 802.1X are discussed, with the latter providing better security through per-client authentication and faster re-keying.
- Radio physics, hardware components (access points, client devices, antennas, and amplifiers), and network topology are covered, emphasizing the importance of treating wireless networks as public and securing them with VPNs.
- Different types of intruders (unintentional, opportunist, and targeted) and their potential liabilities are outlined.
- Passive attacks (e.g., cracking WEP) and active attacks (e.g., rogue access points, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service) on wireless networks are described.
- Active WEP attacks, including known-plaintext and encrypted packet modification attacks, are explained in detail.
- Recommendations for improving wireless security include enabling MAC filtering, regularly checking for rogue access points, and carefully monitoring logs.
- Triangulation of physical locations using directional antennas is possible but slow and challenging.
- Cisco's Leap (Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol) is mentioned as a Webkey rotation standard that is superior to straight WEP.
