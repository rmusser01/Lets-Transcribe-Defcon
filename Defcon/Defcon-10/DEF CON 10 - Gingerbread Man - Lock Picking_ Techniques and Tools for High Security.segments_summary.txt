- Pin Tumbler Locks: These are standard locks used in residential and business settings. They consist of a cylinder and a plug with upper and lower pins that need to align at the shear line for the lock to open. Various picking methods can be used, including feeler picks, rakes, diamond picks, and pick guns.
- Mushroom Spool Pins: An upgrade to pin tumbler locks, featuring pins with varying diameters. To pick these locks, it's important to pick the mushroom pins first to avoid binding at the shear line. Specialized picks like a diamond pick or a feeler pick can be used.
- Tubular Locks: Commonly found on vending machines, these locks have upper and lower pins but with a circular shear line. They can be picked manually or with specialized tubular lock picks, which are more efficient but also more expensive.
- Medico Locks: Also known as bi-axial pin tumbler locks, these locks feature a sidebar in addition to the pins. The pins must be rotated and aligned properly to allow the sidebar to drop and unlock the lock. Mushroom pins and decoy grooves add to the complexity. A sensitive tension wrench is crucial for success.
- Abloy Locks: These keyed disk tumbler locks work similarly to combination locks, with disks that need to be aligned to allow a sidebar to drop. They can be picked using two L-picks or through impressioning, a process of binding and filing a soft metal key to match the disk alignments.
- New Lock Challenges: When encountering a new lock, research is key. Identify the manufacturer, model, and similar locks. Study patents to understand the lock's mechanics and any specialized tools for bypassing it. Practice and experimentation are essential for success.
- Stephen Hampton's Book: Hampton's book on modern high-security locks is recommended as a starting point for those interested in picking high-security locks.
