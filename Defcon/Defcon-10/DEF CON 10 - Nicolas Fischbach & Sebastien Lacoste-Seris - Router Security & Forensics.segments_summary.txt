## Layer 2 Routing Protocols
- Layer 2 protocols are a list of communication protocols used by Layer 2 devices (such as NICs, switches, and multiport bridges) to transfer data in a wide area network or between nodes in a local area network.
- The term "Layer 2" refers to the Data Link Layer in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, which is a standard model for network protocols and distributed applications. 
- The Data Link Layer is responsible for error-free data transmission between devices in the same network and has two sub-layers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer and the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer.
- Common Layer 2 protocols include Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), Forwarding Database (FDB), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), and Multi-link Trunking Protocol (MLT).

## Router Security
- Routers are used to share an internet connection and connect to other devices in homes, offices, and businesses. 
- When choosing a router, consider free security features, Wi-Fi 6 and newer, Ethernet connections, number of radios, streams, and antennas.
- Examples of secure routers include the TP-Link Archer AX11000, ASUS RT-AX68U, and NETGEAR Nighthawk AX2400.

## Router Forensics
- Router forensics involves collecting data from the device that can act as evidence, such as logs and network activity data. 
- The "show" commands in Cisco routers are used to collect most of the required information, including network activity data, audit trails, and hardware information. 
- Advanced data collection methods include creating a core dump, which contains a complete memory image of the router, and using tools like CIR Online to analyze Cisco IOS memory dumps.
