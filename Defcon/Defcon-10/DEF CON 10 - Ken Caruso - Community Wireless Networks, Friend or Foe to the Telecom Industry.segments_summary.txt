- Ken Caruso, co-founder of the Seattle Wireless Project and freenetworks.org, introduces himself and the topic of his talk: community wireless networks and their political and social implications.
- "Free networks" is a term coined to represent the philosophical ideas of community wireless networks, emphasizing freedom and not being tied to a specific technology.
- Free networks aim for decentralized, self-sufficient infrastructure, independent of telecom companies, with no barriers to entry and a focus on local connectivity and privacy.
- The movement is driven by affordable technology, a desire for constant connectivity, and frustration with restrictions imposed by ISPs.
- ISPs and telecom companies have mixed reactions to free networks, with some seeing it as a threat to their business model, while others recognize its potential benefits.
- Community wireless groups have different approaches, with some focused on free internet access and others on building independent metropolitan area networks.
- The success of free networks relies on strong local communities, vendor cooperation, FCC compliance, collaboration among global wireless groups, and effective communication of its benefits to the public.
- The presentation includes photos and stories from various community wireless projects, highlighting their technical approaches, challenges, and unique aspects.
- The Seattle Wireless Project uses static routing and non-routable address space for network management, with plans to adopt IPV6 in the future.
- Quality of service (QoS) and bandwidth-heavy applications are not currently a priority for the Seattle Wireless Project, but they may become relevant as the network grows.
- Liability is not a significant concern for the network as it is primarily focused on local connectivity rather than providing internet access.
- Inner-city connections and nationwide mesh networks are not feasible with the current technology due to scalability limitations of 802.11b.
