- Introduction: Little Wolf (Dennis Madison) discusses attacking printers and other network-attached devices. He emphasizes the importance of full vulnerability disclosure for security awareness.
- Printer History and Vulnerabilities: Older printers were secure, but the addition of serial and parallel ports made them vulnerable. Manufacturers added protocols like web browsing and FTP, making them more susceptible to attacks. Printers often have hard drives, making data recovery possible.
- Physical Security Attacks: Physical access to printers can lead to data theft or network disruption. Attackers can replace printers with malicious devices or perform man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Firmware and Backdoors: Printers with firmware can be exploited by disassembling and modifying the code. Many printers have backdoors for remote access, which are often unsecured and can lead to unauthorized access.
- Denial of Service Attacks: Exploiting vulnerabilities in printers, such as the App Socket interface, can deny printing access to legitimate users.
- Information Access and Distribution: Printers may contain sensitive information, such as print job details and user data. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to access and distribute this information.
- Printer Manufacturer Response: Printer manufacturers often deny or ignore security vulnerabilities. They may blame administrators or researchers, hide vulnerabilities, or threaten legal action.
- Recommendations for Manufacturers and Users: Manufacturers should think outside the box, implement security measures, educate users, and be open-minded about security. Users should change default configurations, disable unnecessary services, use firewalls, and contact vendors about security concerns.
