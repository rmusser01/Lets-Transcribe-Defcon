- Introduction: The presenter will discuss Cetrix, terminal servers, and published applications, with a focus on connecting to and exploiting vulnerabilities in these systems. The presentation slides and tools will be made available online.
- Cetrix and Terminal Services: Explains that terminal services allow multiple users to remotely access and interact with applications running on a server, similar to X in Unix. Cetrix introduces the concept of "published applications," which can be anonymously accessed and executed.
- Finding Published Applications: Port scanning for TCP port 1494 is a common method for discovering published applications. The presenter has developed tools to enumerate published applications and connect to them, even when the master browser is not public.
- Demonstration: The presenter demonstrates the process of discovering and connecting to published applications using their tools, including a proxy to bypass firewall restrictions. They also show how to break out of the restricted environment using common techniques like "File > Open > Explore," pressing F1, or using the task manager.
- Statistics: The presenter shares statistics from a large-scale scan of millions of IP addresses, revealing that a significant percentage of Cetrix servers and published applications are vulnerable to anonymous access and exploitation.
- Mitigation: Emphasizes the importance of firewalls and VPN solutions for securing published applications. Suggests implementing strong ACLs, following Cetrix white papers, and using commercial tools like Absense and Secure Exe for enhanced security.
- Conclusion: The presenter expresses their enthusiasm for further exploration of Cetrix and terminal server vulnerabilities, inviting interested parties to contact them with questions or collaborations.
