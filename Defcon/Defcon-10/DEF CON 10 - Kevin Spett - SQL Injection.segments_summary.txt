- **Web Application Security**: The presentation focuses on the security vulnerabilities of web applications that use Oracle databases.
- **SQL Injection**: This technique allows attackers to manipulate the data returned from a database by injecting malicious SQL code into web application inputs. By exploiting weaknesses in input validation, attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Demonstration of SQL Injection**: The speaker demonstrates how to inject SQL code into a web application's email input field to bypass authentication and retrieve user credentials. He emphasizes the importance of input sanitization to prevent such attacks.
- **Union Select Queries**: The speaker explains how to use union select queries to combine multiple select queries and retrieve data from different tables. This technique is useful for extracting information from specific tables within the database.
- **Oracle-Specific Exploits**: The speaker discusses various Oracle-specific features that can be exploited, such as the UTL_HTTP package, which allows HTTP requests to be made from within a SQL statement. He also mentions the built-in HTTP server that comes with Oracle installations.
- **Retrieving System Information**: The speaker demonstrates how to retrieve system information, such as password policies, stored procedure source code, and operating system details, by querying Oracle's system tables.
- **Data Type Matching**: The speaker explains the importance of matching data types when performing union select queries. He provides examples of using functions like CHR and CISDate to match data types and avoid errors.
- **Oracle Stored Procedures**: The speaker addresses the issue of injecting into Oracle stored procedures. He explains that the number of arguments in the injection string must match the number of arguments in the stored procedure for the attack to succeed.
- **Defense Strategies**: The speaker offers defense strategies for web application developers, including input sanitization, limiting input length, and data type validation. He also recommends using prepared statements and stored procedures instead of dynamic SQL queries.
- **Privilege Escalation and OS Command Execution**: The speaker mentions that while his presentation focuses on web application security, there are other vulnerabilities in Oracle databases, such as buffer overflows and privilege escalation techniques. He acknowledges the interest in arbitrary command execution but states that he hasn't found a way to achieve it yet.
- **Secure Web Application and Database Interaction**: The speaker announces an upcoming paper on secure web application and database server interaction, which will provide guidance on tightening security and minimizing potential damage from SQL injection attacks.
