- **Introduction:** The speakers, Saul, Ruliffe, and Harun from SensePost, a South African security assessment and penetration testing company, present their work on Trojan technology. They emphasize the focus of their talk is on establishing a communications channel with a Trojan in a hostile environment.
- **Background:** Trojans have been used since the early days of computing to gain unauthorized access to systems. With the evolution of security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, Trojans have had to adapt to circumvent these defenses.
- **Previous Approaches:** The speakers discuss the limitations of earlier Trojan communication methods, including direct connections, tunneling, and HTTP tunneling. They highlight the challenges posed by stateful firewalls, IDS, personal firewalls, authentication proxies, and content-checking firewalls.
- **Gatslach:** The speakers introduce Gatslach, their previous Trojan technology that utilized object linking and embedding (OLE) to control a browser and establish a connection. Gatslach overcame some limitations but had issues with IP address traceability and lacked features like GUI support and batch command execution.
- **Satiri:** Satiri is the improved version of Gatslach, addressing its limitations. It moves commands from the title of the web page to the body, enabling batch command execution. It uses a standard web server with CGIs and supports multiple instances of the Trojan, allowing multiple operators to control different Trojans.
- **Anonymity:** Satiri incorporates anonymizer to hide the IP address of the controller, enhancing anonymity. The operator can control the Trojan via a web interface, browsing to the controller instead of being physically associated with the host.
- **Demonstration:** The speakers show the controller's interface for Satiri, explaining its features for entering commands, browsing files, and viewing outputs. They also present a real web page used by the controller, highlighting the embedded commands and parameters.
- **Conclusion:** The speakers emphasize that if users are allowed to browse the internet, this Trojan technology can be effective. They suggest solutions such as whitelisting websites and user education to prevent such attacks. They conclude by acknowledging the limitations of their work and encouraging further development with more resources.
