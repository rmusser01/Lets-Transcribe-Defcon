The speaker, Swift, presents concerns about the upcoming Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), particularly regarding its quality of service (QoS) and potential impact on the open nature of the Internet. IPv6 offers a vast increase in IP addresses and incorporates features like authentication and IPsec. However, QoS can be abused by ISPs to prioritize traffic based on financial incentives rather than actual service needs. This could lead to a "tiered" Internet, favoring corporations and wealthy individuals, reminiscent of the consolidation and commercialization of the media industry. IPv6's improved security and widespread adoption by major companies may hasten this transformation. Swift advocates for a more practical and egalitarian approach to QoS, based on traffic type rather than origin.
