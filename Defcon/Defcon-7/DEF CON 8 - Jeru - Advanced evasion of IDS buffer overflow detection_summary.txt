**DEF CON 8 Talk: Advanced Evasion of IDS Buffer Overflow Detection**

- **Introduction**: Jero from New Hack City presents techniques to evade IDS buffer overflow detection.
- **Background**: Jero's experience in embedded systems, IDS development, and hacking collective New Hack City.
- **Buffer Overflow Refresher**: Overview of buffer overflow attacks, including stack manipulation and shellcode execution.
- **IDS Signatures**: Common signatures used by IDS tools like Snort to detect buffer overflow attempts, e.g. specific instructions, long strings of no-ops, and "/bin/sh" execution.
- **Evading Detection**: Techniques to bypass IDS signatures, including reordering instructions, using different registers, replacing no-ops with other one-byte instructions, and encrypting payloads.
- **Encryption Techniques**: Simple encryption methods like adding/subtracting a constant offset or XOR with a constant/variable.
- **Self-Modifying Code**: Discusses the use of self-modifying code to evade detection, with examples from IMAP and HTTP filters.
- **Decryption Architecture**: Describes a decryption block and encrypted payload architecture for evading IDS.
- **Assembler Considerations**: Discusses issues with using GCC and GAS for exploit development, recommends NASM for full instruction set support.
- **Q&A**: Addresses questions about evasion techniques, virus scans, and detection methods.
