The presentation discusses the growing threat of malicious code distributed via the internet and the need for proactive security measures. It highlights the limitations of traditional antivirus software in detecting and preventing new types of attacks, such as the Love Letter worm and its variants. The speakers propose behavior-blocking technologies that monitor and restrict undesirable actions by programs, sitting between executables and the operating system to track and control their behaviors. They also introduce Gatekeeper, a prototype technology that blocks script-based attacks by limiting access to dangerous objects and methods. The effectiveness of Gatekeeper is demonstrated by showing its ability to prevent the New Love worm from executing and causing damage. The presentation emphasizes the need for defensive measures against malicious code and encourages further research and development in this area.
