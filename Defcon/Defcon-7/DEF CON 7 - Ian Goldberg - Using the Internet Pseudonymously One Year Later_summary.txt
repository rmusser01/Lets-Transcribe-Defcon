Ian Goldberg and Austin Hill, from Zero Knowledge Systems, present Freedom, a software product that enables pseudonymous use of the internet. Freedom aims to provide users with privacy, anonymity, and the ability to choose their geographic location online. The software uses multiple layers of encryption and a network of globally distributed servers, called Freedom Nodes, to obscure user identities and packet information. Zero Knowledge Systems faced challenges, such as developing robust security measures and navigating legal issues, but they are preparing for a controversial launch with a growing user base and interest from various groups, including government agencies. The presentation includes a Q&A session addressing technical details, potential attacks, spam prevention, and comparisons to similar technologies.
