Phil King, a hardware engineer, presents an introduction to microcontroller hacking. He provides an overview of microcontrollers, the benefits of using them, and the components needed to set up a lab for development and testing. King emphasizes the importance of knowing hardware and software, and suggests that 1K of code space is sufficient for most projects. He offers tips on acquiring parts, soldering, and designing for testability. An example project, a keyboard sniffer, is described, and King concludes with an inspirational message, encouraging attendees to explore the creative possibilities of microcontroller hacking.
