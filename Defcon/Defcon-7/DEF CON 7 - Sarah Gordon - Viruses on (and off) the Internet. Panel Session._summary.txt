The DEF CON 7 panel discusses the public availability of computer viruses and their source code on the Internet, moderated mailing lists, and their potential impact. The panel includes diverse perspectives, from a virus writer to antivirus developers and those in favor of strict legal consequences. While some argue that virus writing is a cool way to learn and expose vulnerabilities, others emphasize the potential damage and ethical implications. The discussion also covers the role of full disclosure mailing lists and the responsibility of administrators and vendors in addressing these issues. This conversation highlights the complex dynamics between virus writers, the antivirus industry, and the broader computer security landscape.
