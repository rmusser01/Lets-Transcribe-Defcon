The DEF CON 8 talk by Jennifer Granick, a criminal defense attorney, and Grant Gottfried, a policy analyst, covers laws related to hacking. Granick discusses federal hacking laws, including Section 1030, and how courts interpret "authorization." She also addresses other statutes like possession of access devices, misappropriation of trade secrets, criminal copyright law, and wire fraud. Gottfried focuses on the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), explaining how it regulates email service providers and the disclosure of email content to the government. They emphasize the importance of understanding these laws to protect oneself from legal consequences.
