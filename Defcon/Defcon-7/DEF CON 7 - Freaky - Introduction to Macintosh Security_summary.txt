Freaky mentions specific programs like "On Guard," "Magic Key," "At Ease," and "Foolproof," highlighting their vulnerabilities. Freaky also discusses alternative operating systems for Macintosh, web servers, keystroke loggers, and remote access tools. In addition, Freaky announces upcoming exploits and software releases, such as "Fink" and improved keystroke logger detection methods. The presentation concludes with a Q&A session, covering various topics like password protection, word dialers, and port scanners.
