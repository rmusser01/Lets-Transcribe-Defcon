The presentation explores the legal and ethical implications of "citizen hackers," particularly in the context of international relations and potential acts of war. It discusses the distinction between information warfare and information operations, highlighting the joint doctrine outlined in Joint Publication 313. The law of armed conflict, including the Hague and Geneva Conventions, is examined to define the status of combatants and non-combatants. The role of the United Nations and its impact on sovereign nations' actions are also considered. Ultimately, the conclusion is drawn that citizen hackers have no authority to engage in warfare or information operations on behalf of their state, and the potential consequences of such actions are outlined.
