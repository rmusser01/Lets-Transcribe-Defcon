The DEF CON 7 talk offers an introduction to TCP/IP, covering its history, definitions, and key protocols. TCP/IP, or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, enables computers to communicate regardless of OS or vendor. The protocol suite's history is tied to ARPA's research on networking computers and grew into the Internet. TCP/IP's four layers are: link, network, transport, and application. Encapsulation adds headers and footers at each layer for data transmission. IP handles data packaging and routing; TCP ensures reliable connections and data reassembly; UDP is a lightweight, connectionless protocol. TCP/IP Illustrated and other resources are recommended for further study.
