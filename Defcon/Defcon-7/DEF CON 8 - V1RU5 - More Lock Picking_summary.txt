A group of lock-picking enthusiasts gave a presentation at DEF CON 8, a hacker convention, in 2000. They began by discussing the different types of locks, such as handcuffs and padlocks, and the various tools and techniques used to pick them. One of the presenters, a former magician, shared creative ways to hide lock-picking tools on one's body. The group then explained the mechanics of a typical pin tumbler lock and how to pick it using tension wrenches and picks. They emphasized the importance of lubrication and provided recommendations for beginners, including starting with cheaper lock-picking sets and practicing on locks with lower tolerances. They also mentioned advanced locks, like Medeco and abloy, which require more skill to pick. The presenters offered additional resources for self-study and encouraged attendees to practice and join them for an advanced lock-picking talk at the next DEF CON.
