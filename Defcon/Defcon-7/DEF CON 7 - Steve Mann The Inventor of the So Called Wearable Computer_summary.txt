The transcript is a recording of a lecture by Steve Mann, a professor at the University of Toronto and the inventor of the wearable computer and EyeTap video camera. Mann provides an overview of his inventions, including the mediated reality concept, which alters one's perception of reality by modifying incoming light. He addresses concerns about the technology, such as potential irresponsible uses and physiological repercussions, and emphasizes the importance of open-source and non-viral operating systems to prevent negative impacts. Mann also discusses his other projects, such as "Shooting Back," which involves photographing surveillance cameras, and "Please Wait," a head-mounted display that covers the wearer's face. He highlights the cost and manufacturing challenges of his inventions and expresses his desire to make them accessible to everyone. The lecture concludes with a discussion of Mann's motivations, including his interest in creating personal space and his fascination with light and photography.
