Craig H. Rowland, a security software developer and consultant, gave a talk at DEF CON 7 in 1999 on how to be aware of security problems on your network. Rowland emphasised the importance of monitoring systems closely for problems and outlined free security tools that can help bolster site security. He also discussed his own tools, Log Check, PortSentry, and HostSentry, which aim to keep intruders off hosts by detecting port scans and login anomalies.
