In her talk, Sarah Gordon discusses the impact of legal intervention on virus writing activity. She questions the effectiveness of arrests and sentencing in reducing the threat of computer viruses. Gordon presents her research, which suggests that virus writers are not all "evil, malicious, unethical, antisocial, [and] scum," contrary to the stereotypes portrayed by the media and antivirus companies. She found that most writers had good social lives, ethical norms, and no intention to cause harm. Gordon also analyzed the number of viruses reported before and after high-profile arrests and sentencings, finding no significant decrease. She suggests that making virus writing illegal could make the problem worse and that personal responsibility and information sharing within the tech community are more effective solutions.
