Dr. Byte's DEF CON 7 talk covered the Internet Protocol's transition from version 4 (IPv4) to version 6 (IPv6), exploring the who, what, when, where, how, and why of the update. The presentation included technical details about IPv6's features, deployment, transition from IPv4, and security. IPv6 addresses the limitations of IPv4 by offering a larger address space, improved routing efficiency, and support for device mobility, security, and configuration.
