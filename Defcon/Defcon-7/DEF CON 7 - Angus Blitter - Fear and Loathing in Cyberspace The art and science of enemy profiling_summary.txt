Angus Blitter presents on the art and science of enemy profiling at DEF CON 7, emphasizing its importance in cybersecurity. He defines profiling as a classification system to identify opponents' characteristics, capabilities, resources, and limitations. Blitter argues that profiling is an art rather than a science and aims to make it more scientific. He discusses various entities that use profiling, including insurance agencies, credit card companies, and government agencies. Blitter introduces Project Profiler, a web-based experiment to crowdsource a database of hacker profiles. He outlines a three-phase plan: database population, public database access, and logic refinement. Blitter invites the audience to participate and contribute to the project. The presentation concludes with a Q&A session addressing concerns about data accuracy, motivation tracking, and potential commercial applications.
