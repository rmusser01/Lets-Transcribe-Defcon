DEF CON 7 â€“ TEXTFILES, G-PHILES, AND LOG FILES: REMEMBERING THE 1980s THROUGH ASCII

Jason Scott's DEF CON 7 talk focuses on his website, textfiles.com, and its collection of text files from the 1980s. Scott describes the BBS (Bulletin Board System) scene of the 1980s, where teenagers would share their knowledge, brag, and lie, creating a unique online culture. He explains that text files were an essential part of this culture, containing everything from hacking guides to personal rants. Scott's goal with textfiles.com is to preserve this era of computer history, which he considers to be his childhood. He also discusses the evolution of subcultures and the importance of digital preservation.
