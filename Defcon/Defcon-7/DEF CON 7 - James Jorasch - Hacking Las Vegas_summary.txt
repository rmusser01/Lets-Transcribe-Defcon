The DEF CON 7 talk by James Jorasch, held in Las Vegas in 1999, focuses on gambling, cheating, and casino defense strategies. Jorasch begins by discussing the regulatory agencies and casino hierarchy, including the roles of the VP of Casino Operations, surveillance, and the Black Book and Griffin Book of undesirables. He then delves into cheating methods, such as credit fraud, counterfeiting, slot machine manipulation, and blackjack and roulette scams. He also mentions manufacturer cheating and mistakes made by casinos, such as promotions that favor players. Jorasch concludes by offering legitimate ways to beat the casino, including infrequent gambling, video poker, blackjack card counting, and exploring the comp system.
