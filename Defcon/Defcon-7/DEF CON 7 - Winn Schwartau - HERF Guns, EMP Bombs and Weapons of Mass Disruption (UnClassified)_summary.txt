The DEF CON 7 convention in Las Vegas, NV, in 1999, included a presentation on HERF guns, EMP bombs, and weapons of mass disruption by Winn Schwartau. Schwartau discussed the technology behind these weapons, their effects, and their potential use by the US military and terrorists. He also demonstrated how to build a simple HERF device and warned about the health risks associated with playing with such devices. The presentation concluded with a discussion of potential countermeasures and detection methods. Schwartau's work, along with that of other researchers, has raised concerns about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to electromagnetic attacks.
