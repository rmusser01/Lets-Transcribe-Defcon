**DEF CON 8: Demonstration of Autonomous Nodes by Ender** 

- Presentation introduces the concept of autonomous nodes, small computer programs with artificial intelligence that operate independently, following predefined rules.
- Autonomous nodes differ from intelligent agents that retrieve information based on user input.
- Nodes perform specific tasks and make decisions without external input, aiming for network research and security applications.
- Ender plans to demonstrate NodeH, a node with AI capabilities, at DEF CON, showcasing its functions and decision-making process.
- Nodes can be used for automated exploitation and protection, with an attack tree backbone.
- Sandia, a government job house, uses autonomous nodes for network defense, protecting against hacker attacks.
- The project aims for cross-platform compatibility, currently working on Linux and Windows, with future plans for OpenBSD and other OS ports.
- Autonomous nodes provide a common ground for network security program development and offer advantages in speed, specificity, and scalability.
- Potential future enhancements include incorporating AI for more complex decision-making and behavior.
