The speaker, John Q. Newman, discusses the growing issue of identity theft and how it has become a lucrative crime due to the increasing digitization of personal information. He explains the motivations behind identity theft, which include not only financial gain but also the desire for a fresh start or improved career prospects. Newman then demonstrates the ease with which identity theft can be committed by walking the audience through the step-by-step process used by a professional identity thief he met in the UK. He emphasizes the importance of gathering key personal identifiers such as name, address, social security number, and birthdate, and how these can be obtained through various online and offline sources. He also highlights the role of credit bureaus and information brokers in facilitating identity theft. 

Newman goes on to discuss the impact of the widespread use of social security numbers and the lack of regulation regarding the collection and exchange of personal information. He mentions specific databases, such as the National New Hire Database, that contribute to the erosion of privacy. He also mentions his books, which offer strategies for protecting one's privacy and disappearing, as well as the services provided by Limpanics, a company specializing in fake IDs and publishing. 

Overall, Newman's talk serves as a warning about the vulnerabilities inherent in the current system and the potential consequences for individuals whose identities are stolen. He advocates for greater privacy protections and calls for a re-evaluation of the practices that put personal information at risk.
