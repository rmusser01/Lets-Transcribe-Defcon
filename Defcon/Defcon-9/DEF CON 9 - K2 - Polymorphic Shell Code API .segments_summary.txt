## Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Monitor network traffic for malicious activity and send alerts when it occurs.
- Compare network activity to a set of predefined rules and patterns to identify potential attacks.
- Can be classified into network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host intrusion detection systems (HIDS).
- Most IDS attempt to locate malicious code by searching through computer files and data packets.
- Can be evaded using techniques like fragmentation, packet encoding, traffic obfuscation, and encryption.

## Buffer Overflows
- A security exploit where a program writes data beyond a buffer's allocated memory, overwriting adjacent memory locations.
- Can be triggered by malformed inputs and can result in erratic program behaviour, memory access errors, incorrect results, and crashes.
- Can be exploited to write malicious code into areas of memory that hold executable code.
- Can be prevented by using strongly-typed programming languages, safe libraries, and buffer overflow protection techniques.

## Shellcode
- A small piece of code used as the payload in software vulnerability exploitation.
- Can be local or remote, depending on whether it targets a machine on the same network or a different one.
- Can be encoded, made self-decrypting, or polymorphic to avoid detection by intrusion detection systems.
- Can be alphanumeric or printable, consisting of ASCII or Unicode characters, to appear as text and bypass filters.

## Knopsled
- A technique for exploiting stack-based buffer overflows by increasing the size of the target area.
- Involves corrupting larger sections of the stack with no-op machine instructions and placing an instruction to perform a relative jump to the top of the buffer.
- Allows attackers to guess the location of the buffer instead of the smaller shellcode.

## Polymorphic Shell Code Engine
- A tool to bypass network intrusion detection systems.
- Encodes shellcode prior to launch, making each encoding unique and evading signatures.
- Includes a polymorphic decoder that processes the data on the target host.
- Can be adapted for format strings, shellcode, and binary executing stuff.
- Allows for customisation of the decoder to fit specific requirements.

## Countermeasures
- Measures or actions taken to counter or offset another action.
- Can be "active", where the system user takes an active position to deal with a known incoming incident, or "passive", where the system sets up passive approaches that activate only when it encounters security problems.
- Examples include security software, firewalls, damage control, and system separation.
