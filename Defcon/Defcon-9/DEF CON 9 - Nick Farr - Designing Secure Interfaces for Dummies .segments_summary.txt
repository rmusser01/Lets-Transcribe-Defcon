- Introduction: Nick Farr discusses user interface security design, drawing from his help desk experience and kiosk package development. He highlights the threats posed by both elite hackers and average users to IT departments.
- User Threats: Average users, due to their fallibility and instinctual reactions, can compromise system security. Poor interface design can further lead users to inadvertently breach security settings or fall victim to intruders.
- Pop-up Events: Pop-up windows are jarring and can trigger a slight state of alert in users. No-exit pop-up events and bombardment with multiple windows can be particularly frustrating and exploitative.
- User Paranoia and Comfort: Confusing security settings and inappropriate metaphors can create user paranoia, leading to insecure behavior. Comfortable users may follow routine patterns, making them susceptible to friends-and-family viruses and cute Trojan applications.
- Intelligent Agents: Farr suggests using intelligent agents to predict and adapt to user behavior, automatically adjusting security parameters. This can help manage pop-up bombardments and provide a more secure and usable interface.
- User Control and Information: Don't give users control when they're not qualified to handle it, and avoid providing unnecessary information. This can lead to users taking inappropriate actions, such as switching to less secure alternatives.
- Software Installation: Kiosks and office applications should restrict users from installing new software. Provide users with powerful controls to manipulate objects but not the environment itself.
- Interface Design: Design interfaces that function like a workshop or playground, avoiding irrelevant metaphors. Encourage play and reactivity to new interface technologies. Develop 3D file systems and utilize new input methods like 3D gloves and heads-up displays.
- Subtle Security Cues: Use color, contrast, and sound to convey security levels instead of small icons and pop-up menus. Opaque backgrounds can indicate varying security levels.
- Command Filtering: Implement simple command filtering to prevent users from accessing certain functions, such as opening an MS-DOS window in a browser. This can enhance security without requiring complex intelligent agents.
- User Expectations and Education: Administrators should install only the necessary software for users' jobs. Help desk staff often lack sufficient knowledge, and users need better education on security and interface usage.
- Progressive Disclosure: Employ progressive disclosure to provide users with help and successive levels of information. Use standard iconography and color schemes to indicate security levels and provide detailed explanations.
- Large Attachments: Users often send large attachments because it's the easiest method provided. SneakerNet, or physical delivery of data, can still be more efficient than overloading networks with large files.
