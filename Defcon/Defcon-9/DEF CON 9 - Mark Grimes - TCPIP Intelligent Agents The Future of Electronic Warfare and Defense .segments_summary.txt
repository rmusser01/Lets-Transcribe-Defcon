- Introduction: Mark Grimes (Obitian) presents Intrasion, a tool for exploring raw sockets and packet injection, with a focus on TCP/IP and artificial intelligence.
- Nemesis: A nine-protocol packet injection suite based on Libnet, used for node integrity and evasion testing, router congestion management, and covert channels. It has received media attention and is actively being worked on.
- Artificial Intelligence: Defined as the capacity to acquire and apply knowledge, and create intelligent software that automates human functions. Intelligent programs exhibit behavior similar to humans when confronted with problems.
- Intravenous: An intelligent agent for OpenBSD that includes a client-server design, sensors, an expert system, and an injection engine. It aims to maintain stateful connections and handle TCP fragment reassembly efficiently.
- Packet Filtering and State Tables: Intravenous uses splay trees for efficient packet filtering and state table management, avoiding the vulnerabilities of hash tables. It focuses on stateful user-defined connection filters and minimal state maintenance.
- TCP/IP Header and Fragmentation: Discusses the importance of handling TCP fragment reassembly and the use of MTEU (Maximum Transmission Unit) to manage packet sizes.
- Expert Systems: Intravenous includes an expert system with a knowledge base, inference engine, and rule base for predicting and handling packets. It covers TCP/IP, attack, and defense rules.
- User-Defined Injection and Automated Injection: Intravenous supports user-defined packet injection and automated next-packet injection based on protocol and field values. It aims to maintain stateful connections and handle various attack scenarios.
- Defensive Applications: Intravenous can be used for defensive purposes, such as dynamically adding firewall rules or black hole routes to mitigate attacks and reduce network congestion during incidents.
- Summary: Intravenous is a powerful tool for exploring raw sockets, packet injection, and AI-assisted network interactions. It provides offensive and defensive capabilities while maintaining connection integrity and efficiency.
