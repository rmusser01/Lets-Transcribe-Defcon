- Introduction: Cyrus Picari, CTO of VirusMD Corporation, presents a controversial idea of using computer viruses to strengthen global networks and prevent societal collapse. He acknowledges the potential legal consequences of virus creation and emphasizes the need for permission to alter systems.
- Historical Context: Picari draws parallels between biological viruses and computer viruses, citing examples like the Black Plague and Smallpox that devastated civilizations. He argues that the unchecked proliferation of information networks leaves society vulnerable.
- Current Antivirus Solutions: Picari critiques the limitations of traditional antivirus solutions, using the "I Love You" virus as an example of their failure to prevent global damage. He proposes creating a computer virus vaccine to immunize the entire Internet.
- Vaccine Characteristics: The suggested vaccine should be open-source, international, attenuated (weakened), and live (replicating). Picari acknowledges the challenges posed by the antivirus community's hatred toward virus writers and addresses some of their concerns.
- Vaccine Release: Picari suggests that a global epidemiology body, like the World Health Organization, could be responsible for releasing the vaccine. He acknowledges the complexity of determining the appropriate entity for this task.
- Virus Writers and Ethics: Picari discusses the cycle of virus writer ethics and refutes arguments against the possibility of beneficial viruses. He mentions Midnight's rebuttal to Vessel and Bontchev's paper claiming the impossibility of good viruses.
- Audience Interaction: Picari engages with the audience, answering their questions and addressing concerns. He clarifies that the proposed vaccine aims to raise awareness, strengthen systems, and potentially prevent future global viruses. He acknowledges the challenges of trust, distribution, and ensuring the vaccine's positive impact.
- Conclusion: Picari summarizes his argument for the necessity of computer viruses to stabilize global networks and prevent societal collapse. He invites interested coders to collaborate on developing the vaccine and promotes his upcoming book on Windows Internet Security.
