- Introduction: Timothy Mullen (aka Thor) from the Hammer of God security site discusses Windows security, specifically an exploit related to SQL Server 2000 and its client utilities.
- SQL Server 2000's DB Netlib.DLL: This library supports TCP/IP connections, encryption, and authentication. It is installed by default on workstations with SQL Server 2000 client utilities and MSDE, exposing many systems to potential vulnerabilities.
- Integrated Authentication: SQL Server 2000 allows integrated authentication over port 1433, which is typically open for business use. This enables the transmission of NTLM credentials, creating a security risk.
- Client-Side Exploits: Mullen demonstrates how a malicious website or email can use client-side scripting to establish an ODBC connection, capturing user credentials.
- ActiveX Controls: New ActiveX controls installed with the SQL Server 2000 client utilities are marked safe for scripting, allowing silent interrogation of SQL servers and potential credential theft.
- Mitigation Strategies: Group policies can be used to disable scripting for these ActiveX controls and restrict data source access. Service packs for SQL Server 2000 exist but are rarely installed on client machines. Strong passwords and egress firewall rules are also recommended.
- Potential Impact: Mullen emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities, as they could spread quickly and have significant consequences.
- Q&A: The speaker answers questions about the exploit's compatibility with Windows XP, Kerberos authentication, buffer overflows, and potential mitigation measures.
