- **Introduction to Cloak and Dagger**: A library implementation for privacy applications, enabling covert communication between peers. It aims to provide extreme security assurances, referred to as "cypherpunk grade."
- **Scenario**: MI6 in the UK wants to communicate with field agents in hostile environments like China without risking their lives. The proposed system aims to provide secrecy beyond plausible deniability.
- **Assumptions**: The system assumes a well-resourced adversary (Eve) with full access to network traffic. It also assumes a secure operating system with anti-permisc detection and the ability to resist compromise.
- **Initial Setup**: A cloak-and-dagger-enabled application is delivered to the agent, along with a symmetric key. The application starts local traffic sampling to identify traffic patterns, protocol usage, payload language, and website visits.
- **Public Key Exchange**: A hash function, keyed with the symmetric key, determines the protocols, fields, sentinel values, and timing for the initial exchange. The symmetric key is also used to encrypt the public keys.
- **Traffic Pattern Exchange**: Both peers exchange and diff their locally sampled traffic patterns to determine a lowest common denominator, which is used as input for the hash function that governs protocol usage and timing.
- **Data Hiding**: The system identifies manipulatable fields within protocols and uses sentinel values to indicate whether a field contains hidden data or not. It chops messages into small pieces and embeds them in protocol headers, ensuring full sessions and handshakes are completed.
- **Protocol Emulation**: The system must emulate all protocols it uses to respond to active attackers. This makes the implementation large and complex.
- **Anomalies**: One noticeable anomaly is the sudden increase in communication between two hosts using various protocols. Possible solutions include delaying further data transmission or using a crowds-like system for message remixing.
- **Symmetric Key Management**: The symmetric key is not used for encryption but as input to the hash function. It is constantly updated by exchanging data between peers when no messages need to be sent.
- **Bandwidth and Efficiency**: The method is extremely bandwidth-intensive, sending only a few bytes of secret data for every couple of megabytes of cover traffic. It is intended for ultra-paranoid scenarios where detection could lead to serious consequences.
- **Steganography**: The system considers using steganographic techniques to hide data within payload content, such as graphical images or email messages, but this is not the current focus.
- **Q&A Session**: The presenter answers various questions from the audience, addressing concerns about detection, error correction, asymmetric bandwidth, implementation as a kernel module, and more.
- **Spot the Fed**: The presenter concludes by inviting attendees to participate in a "Spot the Fed" activity.
