- Introduction: Brenner de Winter introduces themselves and their background in programming and security. They mention that the talk will focus on IP Version 6 (IPV6) and its differences from IP Version 4 (IPV4).
- IP Version 4: IPV4 was introduced in 1983 as a war protocol to ensure data delivery even in the event of connection failures. However, it has some issues like ICMP sniffing, IP spoofing, lack of authentication possibilities, and denial-of-service attacks. The protocol is simple, and there have been workarounds for its limitations.
- IP Version 6: The upgrade to IPV6 was intended to be easy, addressing the need for more IP addresses and improving streaming data and mobile device support. IPV6 uses 120-bit addresses, which are harder to remember, and provides different types of addresses (unicast, anycast, multicast) for various routing needs. It also introduces the concept of scoping addresses to control their reach.
- IPV6 Headers: The structure of IPV6 headers is discussed, including the ability to add multiple headers for various purposes. This flexibility can be exploited for network security testing. Authentication and encryption extensions are available, but their effectiveness depends on proper implementation and key management.
- Router Solicitation: IPV6 includes features like router solicitation, neighbor solicitation, and redirect messages, which can be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.
- Adoption and Implementation: Cisco and Nortel have adopted IPV6 in their routers, and a backbone in Japan is running it. Free software, including Linux, is increasingly IPV6-enabled. Microsoft is also starting to support it, and patches indicate active development and bug fixing.
- Security Architecture: IPV6 defines a general security architecture with authentication and encryption options, but key management and processing demands remain concerns.
- New Security Issues: Privacy violations, a bug in the mobile version, and double exploits when tunneling IPV4 within IPV6 are potential issues. ICMP extensions may require re-evaluation of network security configurations.
- Old Security Issues: Man-in-the-middle attacks, sniffing, address spoofing, and end-to-end security remain problematic in IPV6.
- .NET and DevCon: The speaker mentions that Microsoft's .NET framework bypasses firewalls, and DevCon will continue even with the adoption of IPV6.
- Packet Sequencing: IPV6 uses a straight numbering scheme for packet sequencing, which is considered safe if proper application development practices are followed.
- Packet Size: The maximum packet size in IPV6 is one gigabyte, which is significantly larger than in IPV4.
- Deployment Timeline: With support from major companies and governments, IPV6 is expected to be widely deployed within a year or two.
