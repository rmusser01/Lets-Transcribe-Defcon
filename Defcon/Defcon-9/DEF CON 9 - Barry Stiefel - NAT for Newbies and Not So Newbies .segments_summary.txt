- NAT (Network Address Translation) is a security tool that assigns two different IP addresses to a single host, one public and one private.
- NAT has two modes: Hide Mode and Static Mode. Hide Mode is used for hosts that should not be accessible from the internet (e.g. payroll server), while Static Mode is used for hosts that need to be accessible from the internet (e.g. web server).
- NAT hides internal network structure from outsiders, blocks all connections from the internet to hosts using Hide Mode, preserves scarce IP addresses, and prevents leakage around the firewall.
- NAT configuration requires documenting the network, making a plan, and understanding Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), routing issues, and DNS issues.
- NAT provides security at the network architecture level and is harder to screw up than Access Control Lists (ACLs).
