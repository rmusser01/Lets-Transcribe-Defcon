- Introduction: Enrique Sanchez from a European pen testing company presents a proof of concept. He prefers an interactive Q&A session but has lost his glasses, so he may not see everyone who wants to ask a question.
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Sanchez defines an IDS as a system that reports any malicious activity that could compromise a server or network. He explains that an IDS is like a sniffer that reads and filters packets based on patterns and signatures to identify potential attacks.
- Types of IDS: Sanchez distinguishes between host-based and network-based IDS. He mentions specific examples of IDS, including Snort, Dragonfly, Real Secure, and On Guard 24.
- IDS vs. Hacked System: Sanchez compares an IDS to a hacked system, noting that both require traffic and pattern analysis. He highlights the similarities and differences in their objectives and actions.
- Intuition Detects Your System Evasion (IDYS): Sanchez introduces IDYS, a tool that exploits weaknesses in the link between the network, host, and IDS to bypass the IDS without logging any activities. He explains that an IDS relies on the host, and if the host drops packets due to speed limitations, the IDS will not detect them.
- Attack Methodology: Sanchez discusses the calculation to identify the weak link in the system (host, IDS, or network) and determine the breaking point. He suggests distributing the attack across multiple servers to increase the chances of success.
- Practical Considerations: Sanchez addresses concerns about the practicality of the attack, including the number of attackers with high-speed connections and the need for load balancing. He mentions working code but refrains from sharing it for security reasons.
- Demonstration Offer: Sanchez proposes a live demonstration but admits he didn't prepare enough materials due to time constraints and alcohol consumption.
- Solutions: Sanchez emphasizes the importance of ensuring the IDS's scalability matches the network's scalability. He suggests hardware solutions, load balancing, taking unusual network peaks seriously, and configuring firewalls wisely.
- Q&A Session: Sanchez answers various questions from the audience, including queries about the attack's impact on the network, the probability of the attack reaching the host, the detection capabilities of different IDS, and potential countermeasures.
- Testing Results: Sanchez shares his testing results, mentioning that NFR, Dragonfly, Snort, and Real Secure performed well. He notes that the host's performance is a critical factor, with Windows struggling at 15 megabits and Open BSD reaching 28 megabits.
- Conclusion: Sanchez provides his contact information and invites questions, rants, and flames. He requests no spam and thanks the audience.
