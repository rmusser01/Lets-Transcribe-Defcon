- Introduction: Richard Thiem and his extraordinary knowledge and virtues are welcomed and praised. The context is set for a discussion on the changing nature of hacking and the importance of perspective.
- Cognitive Space: The cognitive space of humanity has been transformed by technology, creating a new interactive, modular, and fluid reality. This space was co-created by early hackers, and it has now become mainstream.
- Context and Content: Shifts in context create new content. Hacking emerged in a specific cognitive space and has since evolved. As hacking becomes accepted and mainstream, it is important for hackers to remain on the edges, seeking truth and avoiding assimilation.
- Truth and Edges: Truth moves from the edges to the center. Hackers must continually seek new edges to find the truth that sets them free. This involves exploring new play spaces, such as the wetware-dryware interface and space exploration.
- Deception and Cover: Illusion, misdirection, and ridicule are hallmarks of deception operations. Hackers must learn to manage their egos, build trusted communities, and constantly fact-check to uncover truth and create alternative models of reality.
- Interaction with Midstream: Hackers should not isolate themselves but strive to create something useful and share it with the wider world. This involves empowering people and using information technology for higher values.
