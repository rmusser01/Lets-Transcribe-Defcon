- Introduction: Bob Grill and Mike Cohen, auditors at a large bank in California, present on Windows NT and Novell logging from an auditor's perspective. They emphasize the importance of log review for security and compliance purposes.
- Auditing Concepts: Audits should be independent of operations, with separation of duties, read-only access, authorization, accounting, and audit log tamper detection.
- Audit Goals and Threats: Auditing tracks user actions, resource usage, file system security, access control, and login/logoff activity. By enabling success and failure auditing for specific events, auditors can detect intrusion attempts, stolen passwords, and unusual activity.
- Windows NT Auditing: NT's native auditing tools provide basic functionality but lack the independence and query capabilities desired by auditors. Third-party tools like BindView offer improved features such as independence from operations and robust querying.
- Novell Auditing: Novell's AuditCon utility is a powerful tool for auditing specific events, users, and file activities. BindView is also recommended for Novell auditing due to its ability to query multiple servers simultaneously and provide detailed reports.
- Suggested Reports and Considerations: Reports on failed login attempts, file access, attribute changes, trustee assignments, and policy changes are suggested for both Novell and NT environments. Remote logging, event correlation, and change control auditing are also discussed as bleeding-edge practices.
- Event ID and Resource Information: Websites and resources are provided for further information on event IDs, NT and Novell auditing, and auditing tools.
