- OpenSSH: A tool for secure shell (SSH) access with additional features for encryption, authentication, and port forwarding.
- Usability: Emphasizes the importance of making security tools user-friendly to encourage adoption and avoid workarounds.
- X11 Forwarding: Disabled by default in modern OpenSSH due to security concerns, but can be enabled with precautions.
- Windows Compatibility: Cygwin provides a Unix-like environment on Windows, including an SSH client.
- Key Generation: Covers basic commands for generating and managing SSH keys.
- Command Execution: Demonstrates how to execute commands remotely and use SSH's 8-bit clean functionality.
- CD Burning: Explains how to burn CDs remotely using SSH and standard Unix commands.
- File Transfer: Criticizes SCP and SFTP, suggesting an alternative approach using standard Unix commands within the SSH framework.
- Port Forwarding: Explains local and remote port forwarding, addressing limitations and access methods.
- Dynamic Forwarding: Introduces an undocumented feature for handling dynamic destinations and multiple sites.
- SOX Programming: Advocates for a simpler implementation of the protocol, requiring only a few lines of code.
- Application Support: Highlights the compatibility of various applications with dynamic forwarding, including web browsers, instant messengers, and voice-over IP software.
- VPN Solution: Discusses the limitations of SSH as a full VPN solution and suggests using PPP over SSH as an alternative.
- Proxy Commands: Explores the use of proxy commands for SSH connectivity, including a complex example using Netcat.
- Host Key Verification: Emphasizes the importance of host key verification for security and mentions SRP as a potential solution.
- Network Firewalls: Proposes a solution for connecting firewalled machines by meeting in the middle through a mutually accessible host.
- Live Configuration: Mentions upcoming enhancements for modifying SSH options without disconnecting.
- SU Command: Warns against the insecurity of the SU command and suggests using SSH for privilege escalation instead.
- Root Access: Discusses the challenges of managing root access and suggests using individual public keys for each user with root privileges.
- PPP over SSH: Demonstrates how to use Pop Top and Slurp for network isolation and remote PPP encapsulation.
- Crypto Hardware Accelerators: Briefly mentions their potential compatibility with OpenSSH and the increasing speed of software-based encryption.
- Lock-Drop Method: Proposes a file-based encryption system that separates encryption and decryption keys for enhanced security.
- SSL vs. SSH: Criticizes the lack of security in many SSL-based file upload scripts and highlights SSH's ability to securely encapsulate generic functionality.
