- Dr. Ian from Zero Knowledge Systems presents a paper on "Arranging Anonymous Rendezvous" to extend privacy protection to internet servers, not just consumers.
- The "Nimmity slider" illustrates levels of identity disclosure in transactions, from veronymity (true name) to unlinkable anonymity (e.g., cash transactions).
- Protocols like IP inherently reveal source addresses, but privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) can protect metadata and message existence, in addition to message content.
- Current PETs focus on client-side anonymity, but server-side anonymity is needed to protect operators of controversial online services from persecution.
- A proposed "rendezvous server" system would enable anonymous connections between clients and servers, with no central point of attack, using distributed lookup services like Nutella.
- The system design includes measures to handle server failures and prevent attacks through digital signatures and reputation capital.
- The paper provides details on system robustness and potential solutions for ongoing conversations when servers go down.
