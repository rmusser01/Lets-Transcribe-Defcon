- Introduction: Bing Zhong, Zanjee (COFIT), and Yeming Chen present their research on a country-wide survey of wastewater security in Taiwan, conducted twice with a one-and-a-half-year interval.
- Motivation: The rise of e-commerce and recent cyber-attacks raise concerns about web server security and user privacy.
- Methodology: The study used banner grabbing and intrusive tests on a sample of 500 servers to assess vulnerabilities.
- Factors Affecting Website Security: Vulnerable CGIs installed by administrators and server vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer flow in IIS servers).
- Classification of Attacks: Includes command rewrite, permission changes, information leakage, denial of service, remote file access, and command execution.
- Results: In 2000, 40% Apache, 40% IIS servers; in 2001, ~55% IIS. High vulnerability rates persist, with little improvement over time.
- Conclusion: Emphasizes the importance of FQDN for incident response and highlights administrator negligence in CGI and patch management. Proposes education and policy interventions.
