- Introduction: Emphasis on the limitations of traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and the need for a community-based, open-source alternative.
- Deficiencies of typical IDSs: Lack of adaptability, limited response options, inability to automatically stop intruders, high cost, and reliance on signatures that are not updated frequently enough.
- Philosophy of Air IDS: Emphasis on intelligent response, multiple data sources, non-disruptive operation, openness, flexibility, and affordability.
- Components of Air IDS: Stealth sensors, centralized data gatherer, historical comparison module, command rules processor, anti-shoot-ourselves-in-the-foot module, and heuristic/learning mode.
- Stealth sensors: Bridging firewalls with OpenBSD, communicating via an out-of-band network, able to block, allow, ignore, redirect, or log traffic, and sending data to a standardized SQL server.
- Centralized information repository: Hardened host with a journaling file system, regular backups, and an out-of-band network, storing all relevant data including syslog, IDS data, and host alerts.
- Historical comparison module: Detects repeat offenders, nuisance users, and stealth port scans by analyzing data from the centralized information repository.
- Command rules processor: Adjusts rules dynamically, interacts with firewalls, blocks problematic hosts, and takes corrective action based on host and network inputs.
- Anti-shoot-ourselves-in-the-foot module: Contains lists of critical hosts, trust relationships, and knowledge about the network to prevent unintended disruptions.
- Open-source network components: Snort, SSH, Zebedee, and Pearl/other scripting languages.
