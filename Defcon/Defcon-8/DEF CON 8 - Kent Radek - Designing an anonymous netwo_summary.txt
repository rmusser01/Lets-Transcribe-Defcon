The speaker introduces Puzzlenet, a new anonymous file-sharing network that addresses some limitations of existing networks like Freenet, Gnutella, and Napster. Puzzlenet aims to facilitate faster downloads, especially for large files, by leveraging users' upload and download bandwidth. It emphasizes anonymity through cryptography and distributed data storage. The speaker outlines Puzzlenet's design, including puzzle pieces, search and download processes, verification, injection, and attack detection. The network dynamically adapts to defend against attacks like denial-of-service, data corruption, and black hole attacks. Puzzlenet also supports large file sizes and offers flexibility in encryption and metadata options during file injection. The speaker concludes by providing links to Puzzlenet and other similar networks.
