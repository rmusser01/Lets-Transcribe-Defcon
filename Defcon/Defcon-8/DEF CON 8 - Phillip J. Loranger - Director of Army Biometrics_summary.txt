The speaker, Phillip J. Loranger, presents the Department of Defense's (DoD) efforts to implement biometrics as a security measure. He highlights the challenges of password management and the complexity of the DoD's systems, which include multiple contractors and subcontractors. Loranger emphasizes the need for a solution that improves identification and authentication while reducing the burden on soldiers. He discusses the limitations of passwords and the potential of biometrics, such as fingerprint, facial recognition, and iris scan technologies. The DoD is tasked with developing standards, testing and evaluating commercial biometrics software and hardware, and defining equipment requirements. Loranger outlines the program's muscle groups, which include a program management office, a national and international laboratory for biometrics, and a repository for safeguarding templates. He also addresses legal, privacy, and social concerns, ensuring civil rights protections. The DoD is partnering with industry to develop standards and integrate biometrics into existing systems. Loranger presents a strategy for pilots and the process for transitioning successful products into full integration. He emphasizes the importance of removing passwords and improving security, especially in weapon systems. The presentation concludes with a Q&A session, addressing concerns about template security, biometric sensors, and the potential for forced biometric access.
