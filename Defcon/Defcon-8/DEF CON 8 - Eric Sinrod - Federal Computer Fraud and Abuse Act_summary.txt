The Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is the primary statute in the US that addresses computer-related crimes. It was enacted in 1986 and has been amended several times since, with proposed amendments currently pending in Congress. The statute covers seven areas of potential criminal liability: espionage, improper obtaining of information, improper access to government computers, fraud, transmission of damaging programs/codes, extortion, and potential civil liability. The definition of "damage" under the statute is important, with a threshold of $5,000 in losses or harm to medical care, physical injury, or public health/safety.
