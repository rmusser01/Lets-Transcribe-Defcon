A speaker at DEF CON 8 presents an introduction to computer viruses, covering various types such as boot sector, file infector, multipartite, polymorphic, macro, Trojan, and script viruses. They explain how these viruses infect systems, the types of damage they can cause, and methods for removal and protection. The speaker emphasizes the importance of updating antivirus software and using multiple antivirus products for better protection. They also discuss the evolution of viruses, including the use of polymorphic and encrypting techniques to evade detection. Additionally, the speaker addresses the impact of popularity on virus prevalence, with Windows being the dominant operating system and, therefore, a primary target. They conclude by highlighting the potential future of computer viruses, including the combination of Visual Basic scripts and binary hostile code, which could lead to widespread infections without users even reading emails.
