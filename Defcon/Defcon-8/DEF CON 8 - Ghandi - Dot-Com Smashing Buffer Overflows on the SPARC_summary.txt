The DEF CON 8 talk by Ghandi, "Dot-Com Smashing: Buffer Overflows on the SPARC," covers buffer overflows on the SPARC architecture and associated shellcode creation. Ghandi begins with an introduction to SPARC assembly, RISC, load/store architecture, register windows, stack allocation, and calling conventions. The discussion includes an overview of traps, hand-assembling instructions, and the use of debuggers like GDB and ADB. Ghandi then delves into shellcode creation, focusing on the differences between Intel and SPARC architectures. The stack behavior on SPARC is highlighted, along with techniques for delivering the payload. Real-world examples of buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Solaris and their exploitation are presented. Ghandi also shares their process for writing shellcode, including tools like disassemblers and assemblers. The talk concludes with links to useful resources for further exploration.
