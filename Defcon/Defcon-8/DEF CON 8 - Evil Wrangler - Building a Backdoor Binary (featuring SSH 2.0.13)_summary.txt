A speaker at DEF CON 8 presents a method for creating a backdoor binary to gain unauthorized access to a secure system. The process involves understanding the code, modifying it without breaking functionality, building and installing the modified version, and sharing the information with the hacking community. Key considerations include file size, checksums, access timestamps, understanding the source code behavior, testing, and avoiding detection by system administrators. The speaker also emphasizes the importance of coding well, choosing inconspicuous passwords, and planning for future expansions. Additionally, they offer tips for protecting against trojan binaries and encourage attendees to share their knowledge.
