The talk, presented by Natasha Gregori and Rloxy, focuses on the issue of child pornography on the internet and the efforts to combat it. Gregori recounts the formation of the ACPM (Anti-Child Porn Militia) in 1999, which aimed to remove child pornography through any means necessary. However, they faced challenges as the sites would often come back online and become more difficult to take down. This led to a transition into a "legit" activist group, ACPO, which forged strong bonds with law enforcement and successfully identified both distributors and recipients of child pornography. The group has since become a non-profit organization with a structured board of directors and a global network of liaisons. D'Quest, the French and European representative, emphasizes the importance of building a network of official contacts and the role of Team ACPO in developing tools to automate tasks and create cross-platform software to filter and prevent access to child pornography. R. Locksley from Condemned.org shares their similar journey and the challenges of transitioning from a hacker-based group to a legitimate organization. They emphasize the importance of educating hackers about the legal consequences of their actions and redirecting their energy towards building tools to fight child pornography. Blueberry, the Australian component of Condemned.org, calls for self-regulation in the web hosting industry to prevent censorship. Detective Mark Lannerman cautions against unauthorized computer access and encourages reporting child pornography to local and state authorities. The discussion highlights the global nature of the problem and the need for faster law enforcement response to stay ahead of the constant emergence of new sites.
