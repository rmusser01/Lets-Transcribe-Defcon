Robert Graham, co-founder, CTO, and chief architect at Network ICE, presents techniques for evading network-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). He begins by critiquing the flaws of commercial IDSs, highlighting their ineffectiveness against skilled hackers and their tendency to fail under heavy loads or complex traffic. Graham then introduces classic IDS evasion techniques, such as fragmentation using tools like FragRouter and Nmap, flooding the IDS with Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and exploiting vulnerabilities in specific protocols like FTP and DNS. He also discusses more advanced methods, including randomizing packet fragmentation and record marking in RPC (Remote Procedure Call) and manipulating telnet option codes in FTP. Graham concludes by emphasizing the need for IDS vendors to address these vulnerabilities and improve their systems' resilience.
