- **Web Application Security**: The presenter has worked in web application security for three years and will focus on client-side connection security, including browser and cookie attacks.
- **Types of Web Applications**: There are three main types: those that allow HTML input and echo, those that don't allow HTML at all, and those that use a subset of HTML or Java-based engines.
- **CGI (Common Gateway Interface) Exposures**: Exposures include system exploits, browser redirects, page spoofing, cookie theft, and user information tracking.
- **Cookie Security**: Cookies are used for authentication and session maintenance. The security implementation restricts access to cookies from a specific domain. However, recent versions of Internet Explorer may have weakened this restriction.
- **JavaScript Access and Exploits**: JavaScript has access to browser information, IPs, plugins, cookie files, and environmental variables. Exploits include grabbing cookie data and sending it to an attacker's domain through image sourcing or other methods.
- **HTML and JavaScript Filtering**: To prevent exploits, certain HTML tags and JavaScript expressions should be filtered or stripped from user input. These include the P tag, applet tag, script tag, style tag, and various others. Even with filtering, some exploits can still bypass security measures by using carriage returns, HTML entities, or other techniques.
- **Auditing and Exploiting Web Forms**: When auditing a system, examine URLs, source code, form values, and link URLs. Exploits can include modifying form values (e.g., changing the price of an item) or manipulating hidden variables.
- **Defense Strategies**: Do not trust any user input. Check and strip all input for potential security risks. Create libraries to handle HTML stripping and input validation. Use separate domains for cookies to add an extra layer of security. Implement server-side hashing of form submissions to prevent off-site form submissions.
- **Viewing Source Code and DMCA**: The presenter wonders if viewing the source code of a web page could fall under unauthorized access or reverse engineering under the DMCA.
- **URL Hiding Techniques**: Techniques like parent frames, hidden I-frames, and URL encoding can be used to disguise the URL of a page. However, these methods may not always be effective.
