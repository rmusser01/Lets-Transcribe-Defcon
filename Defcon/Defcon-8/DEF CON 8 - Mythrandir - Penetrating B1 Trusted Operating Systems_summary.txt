The speaker, Jeff Thompson (aka Mithrandir), a director at Argus Systems Group, presents a talk on hacking B1 trusted operating systems. He begins by explaining the basic concepts of trusted operating systems, including privileges, authorizations, and mandatory access control (MAC). He emphasizes the importance of understanding these concepts to effectively attack a trusted system. 

Thompson then discusses the differences between standard Unix systems and trusted operating systems, highlighting the need to change one's mindset when approaching a trusted system. He mentions that root access is not the primary goal, as access is controlled by both Discretionary Access Control (DAC) and MAC. He suggests focusing on obtaining administrative commands, privileges, and authorizations instead. 

The talk proceeds to offer specific strategies for attacking trusted operating systems. Thompson suggests looking for executables and daemons with special privileges, exploiting buffer overflows to gain shell access, and checking for trusted library paths that could provide unauthorized access. He also emphasizes the importance of understanding Security Label (SL) levels and how they impact file and process access. 

Additionally, Thompson provides tips on getting files into system directories, leveraging network labeling to gain access, and exploiting kernel bugs. He encourages attendees to obtain their own trusted operating systems to practice securing and breaking them. He concludes by mentioning some commercial trusted operating systems available and providing resources for further learning.
