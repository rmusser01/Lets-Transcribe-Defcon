The presentation by Tim Lawless from the University of Southern Mississippi focuses on "Saint Jude," an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) project aimed at detecting and responding to unauthorized root transitions. The recent interest in security has benefited Network IDS development but left Host-based IDS lagging, often detecting breaches too late. Saint Jude aims to protect administrators from intruders gaining access through legitimate channels by modeling, detecting, and responding to root compromises. The project involves developing a kernel-level IDS for Solaris and Linux, minimizing false positives and negatives, and using a reference monitor and rule-based anomaly detection. Lawless demonstrates how the module catches and kills buffer overflow and set UID root exploits, emphasizing its potential as a last-ditch defense. He also discusses rule sets, performance, and future improvements, including collaboration with other security projects. The project's source code and presentation are available online, inviting further contributions and testing.
