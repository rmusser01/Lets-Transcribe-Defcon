**DEF CON 8 Talk: IP Spoofing and Source Routing with Linux 2.0.X by Ian Vitek**:

- **Introduction**: Vitek discusses hacking firewalls and filtering routers using IP and MAC address spoofing. He demonstrates two techniques, including passive network mapping and source routing.
- **Tools for Eavesdropping**: Vitek recommends tools like "siphon," "dsniff," and "tcpdump" for gathering information such as open ports and active connections.
- **Linux Configuration**: He highlights the importance of enabling IP forwarding and disabling the drop of source-routed frames in the Linux kernel. IP aliasing is also mentioned.
- **Passive Network Mapping**: By using tools like "Cphone" and "dsniff," Vitek shows how to identify open ports and active connections on a target network. This information is crucial for IP spoofing.
- **Source Routing**: Vitek explains source routing and how it can be exploited. He demonstrates how to set up a full connection using Netcat and source routing to bypass filtering routers.
- **Vanilla IP Spoofing**: He presents a technique called "full connection, vanilla IP spoofing," which involves changing the MAC address and adding multiple IP addresses to the network interface. This allows for establishing full connections and running tools like Nmap and Nessus.
- **Exploiting Filtering Routers**: Vitek showcases a common rule in filtering routers/firewalls that allows traffic from trusted networks to reach specific destinations. By spoofing an IP address from the trusted network, an attacker can bypass this rule and establish a full connection.
- **Disabling Source Routing**: He emphasizes the importance of disabling source routing on routers to prevent IP spoofing attacks. Implementing spoofing protection and using VPN solutions are recommended.
- **Conclusion**: Vitek urges the audience to take IP spoofing seriously and implement countermeasures, especially when allowing access to untrusted networks. He also mentions potential issues with switched networks and suggests further research.
