The speaker, Norris, an anonymous re-mailer operator, discusses the importance of widely-available anonymity tools, particularly anonymous re-mailers, in an age of increasing surveillance and government control. They provide a historical overview of the development and use of anonymous re-mailers, including the Pennet system, Cypherpunk or Type 1 Remailers, and Mixmaster or Type 2 Remailers. Norris highlights the limitations and vulnerabilities of each system, such as single points of failure and traffic analysis attacks. They also explain the reasons why people use re-mailers, ranging from personal privacy to whistleblowing. Additionally, Norris addresses the challenges of running a re-mailer, including legal threats, ISP objections, and the need for more operators to ensure the network's survival. The presentation concludes with a discussion of recent developments and future directions for the anonymous re-mailer network.
