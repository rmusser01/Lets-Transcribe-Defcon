- **Tunneling**: Creating a virtual data path between two computers using another protocol, allowing access to blocked ports/services. Example: Using HTTP to tunnel Telnet.
- **Software**: Popular tunneling software includes HTTP Tunnel by No Crew, with other homegrown solutions available. These tools help bypass firewall restrictions.
- **Example Network**: Demonstration of a network with a firewall blocking all outgoing ports except 80 (HTTP). Using tunneling software, a virtual data path is established, allowing Telnet (port 23) connection.
- **HTTP Tunneling**: Encapsulating commands/data into HTTP packets, sent via HTTP to the other machine, which extracts and executes them. Simple protocol with seven requests for various functions like open, data, padding, error, etc.
- **Why Tunnel?**: Reasons include static programs requiring specific ports, limited external access, and restrictive system administrators.
- **Combating Tunneling**: Sniffers, signature detection, policy enforcement, and user education are methods to combat tunneling. Explaining security risks and providing alternatives can deter users.
- **Future of HTTP Tunnel**: Plans include SSL encryption, data compression, FTP support, and improved detection evasion.
- **Security Concerns**: Tunneling can bypass firewalls if misconfigured. Educating users and enforcing security policies are key defenses.
- **Performance**: Overhead of encapsulating commands/data can impact performance, especially with bandwidth-intensive protocols like X. Compression can help mitigate this.
- **Proxy Support**: HTTP Tunnel supports standard proxies like squid, but clear text passwords are vulnerable to sniffing. Using SSH or similar protocols for security is recommended.
- **Firewall Limitations**: Firewalls cannot prevent all outbound tunneling. Network address translation and masquerading can hinder return paths.
- **User Education**: Understanding user needs and providing alternatives can reduce tunneling usage.
- **Conclusion**: Firewalls are a good start, but user education and ongoing security measures are crucial. Tunneling software can bypass firewalls if not properly secured.
