The speaker presents a protocol for circumventing network-level censorship, particularly in countries like China, where simply attempting to bypass restrictions can result in punishment. The protocol aims to be undetectable by censors, even if they know the details. It focuses on steganography rather than encryption, as the act of circumventing is often enough to incur penalties. The speaker discusses the limitations of existing solutions and the challenges of designing a secure protocol. They emphasize the need to "get it right the first time" instead of an arms race approach, where protocols are constantly updated to counter detection. The protocol involves a user (Alice) communicating with an external machine (Bob) to access blocked content. The speaker outlines the requirements and constraints, such as the need to disguise URL requests as normal web surfing traffic and the difficulty of transmitting data securely. They propose a solution that involves Alice's machine running a miniature proxy server to convert URL requests into innocuous-looking text queries sent to Bob. The response from Bob must also be disguised, and the speaker mentions Peter Wehner's mimic functions for generating text that looks like English but hides data. The speaker concludes by addressing some potential questions and emphasizing the importance of secure state cryptography and circumvention methods.
