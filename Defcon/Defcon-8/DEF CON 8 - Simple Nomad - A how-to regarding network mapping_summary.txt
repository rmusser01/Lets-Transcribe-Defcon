In this presentation, the speaker, an employee of BindView, shares their expertise in network mapping and penetration testing. They emphasize the importance of gathering public information, network enumeration, and scanning to gain a comprehensive understanding of the target network. Techniques such as ICMP manipulation and TCP fingerprinting are discussed, as well as the use of tools like Nmap for scanning and traceroute for mapping. The speaker also addresses ways to bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems. They introduce a novel attack model that utilizes compromised upstream hosts to conceal the true source of attacks, allowing for stealthy probing and engagement. Additionally, they provide recommendations for free security tools and acknowledge the contributions of other researchers in the field.
