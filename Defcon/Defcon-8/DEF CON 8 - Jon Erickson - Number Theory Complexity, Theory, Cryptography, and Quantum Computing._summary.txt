In a talk at DEF CON 8, Jon Erickson discusses number theory, complexity theory, cryptography, and quantum computing. He covers topics such as big O notation, the Euclidean algorithm, modular arithmetic, and Euler's totient function, which is the basis for RSA encryption. Erickson also introduces the concepts of quantum bits (qubits), superposition, entanglement, and decoherence. He explains how quantum computers can break RSA encryption and improve searching algorithms. Additionally, he mentions quantum encryption and the BB84 protocol, which uses polarized photons and random filters to ensure secure communication. The presentation includes audience interactions and technical challenges, and ends with a brief Q&A session.
