- Introduction: Inertia discusses IntermarCOS, a Linux distribution developed by the Nomad Mobile Research Center, aiming for a stable, secure, and trusted system.
- Target Audience and Installation: Initially intended for advanced users, IntermarCOS shifted focus to target less knowledgeable users, providing a locked-down system that administrators can unlock for internet access.
- Choice of Debian: IntermarCOS is based on Debian due to its high quality, up-to-date documentation, and ease of creating derivative CDs.
- Kernel and Security: The system uses a tweaked Kernel 2.2 with various security patches, prioritizing stability and security. Nomad handled most kernel modifications.
- Package Management: IntermarCOS utilizes AAPT for package management, allowing easy grafting onto Debian. Customized applications like Pine and Sendmail are included.
- Development and Distribution: Inertia explains the process of creating non-kernel and kernel packages, encouraging users to contribute packages or create their own distributions.
- Future Plans: The team plans to enhance user privacy and explore opening up the development process. They also consider an RPM/Red Hat-based version and provide tools for creating IntermarCOS-based CDs.
- Trusted Path and Kernel Modifications: Nomad explains the trusted path enforcement and mentions other kernel mods, including the Openwall and HAP Linux patches.
- Differences with Debian: The team chose to create their own distribution due to paranoia and differences in design choices, such as clearing the screen upon logout.
- Firewall and Source Packages: IntermarCOS uses IP chains for firewall functionality. Deb source packages are available on the NMR website.
