- **Theft of Service Attacks:** These are application-level attacks where an attacker gains increased access to limited resources, often without administrator privileges. Examples include software downloads, web hosting, and email services.
- **Hacker Conventions and Hotels:** Fake badges can be created to access events and exploit vulnerabilities in registration systems.
- **Instant Account Creation and Subscription Data:** Instant activation and account creation can lead to vulnerabilities, especially when combined with weak authentication methods.
- **HTML Form Alteration:** Attackers can modify hidden form fields and submit manipulated data, bypassing validation checks such as HTTP referrers.
- **PayPal and Credit Card Payment Attacks:** PayPal forms can be altered to change prices or subscription terms. Credit card fraud, price alteration, and subscription extension are also possible.
- **Preventing and Responding to Attacks:** Techniques include CRC variable checksum, HTTP referrer checks, and avoiding form variables. Human verification of orders and regular audits are important.
- **DirecTV Theft of Service:** DirecTV sued customers for alleged piracy, but the issue was due to an insecure system. Suing customers is not an effective solution and can lead to legal and financial consequences.
