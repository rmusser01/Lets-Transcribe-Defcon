- Introduction: The team from Tri Valley Security Group presents their project - a stealthy, hostile packet sniffer disguised as a UPS device. The goal is to infiltrate NATted networks by placing the device inside the target organization.
- Hardware: The team modified a standard UPS by stripping its insides and replacing them with custom hardware, including a Pentium 166 processor, 128MB RAM, and a 1GB hard drive. They emphasize the importance of maintaining the stock appearance of the UPS for stealth.
- Software: The software stack includes Red Hat 7-2, Netcat, D-sniff, NMAP, and Hacker's Choice. The device has four modes of operation, ranging from stealthy (no IP) to noisy (DHCP mode) with varying levels of detectability.
- Network Communication: The device periodically connects to a listing post (command queue server) to receive commands. It uses a DNS-like beacon with encryption and key exchange for communication. Failed connections fall back to a reverse shell over TCP port 80.
- Future Improvements: The team discusses potential enhancements, such as improving DNS tunneling to mimic DNS requests more closely and adding SMTP mail attachments for exfiltration.
