- Introduction: Chung's Donut Shop presents the Luna Correspondence Protocol, a new protocol for secure and anonymous data transmission over the Internet.
- Problem Statement: The security of the digital world is at stake due to increasing governmental bureaucracy and surveillance. The team aims to protect freedom of speech and privacy rights.
- Project Overview: Luna Correspondence Protocol utilizes methodologies such as ICMP traffic, IP address and MAC address spoofing, data reordering, delay, and encryption to achieve anonymity and security.
- Anonymity: The protocol aims to avoid creating patterns by spreading data across multiple hosts and using multiple relays. This makes it difficult for snooping parties to trace the origin or destination of the data.
- Security: The protocol employs a mathematical permutation function and packet-level transmission to secure data. Data filters, including encryption and encoding, are applied to further enhance security.
- Practical Applications: The protocol can be used in various scenarios, from sensitive government operations to anonymous communication in restricted networks. It also has creative implementations, such as anonymous internet access in public places.
- Q&A: The team addresses questions about packet loss, IPV6 compatibility, key distribution, reordering of packets, security compared to one-time pads, multiple sending and receiving hosts, and reliance on ICMP echo messages.
- Conclusion: The software will be released on SourceForge, initially for Unix and later for Windows.
