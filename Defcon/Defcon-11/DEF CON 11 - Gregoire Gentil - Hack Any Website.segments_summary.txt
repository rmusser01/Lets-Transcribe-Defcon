- **Introduction to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: MitM attacks take advantage of unprotected clients to intercept and modify communications between a client and a server.
- **Demo 1: IBM Lotus iNotes Webmail Interface**: The attacker modifies the response from the server, switching the "Open" and "Remove" functions in the pop-up menu. As a result, when the user selects "Open" on an email, it gets deleted from the server.
- **Demo 2: CNN Webpage**: The attacker intercepts the HTML page from the CNN server and modifies a specific tag. They also connect to a malicious server to retrieve new content, which is then displayed to the client.
- **History and Exploitation of Browser Helper Objects (BHOs)**: BHOs were introduced by Internet Explorer in 1997 (with the release of IE4) to open up the browser structure for third-party modifications. However, the lack of security around this feature allows attackers to fully modify HTML pages without any user warning.
- **Technical Details of BHO Attack**: The attacker creates a COM in-process DLL, registers it, and loads it into the Internet Explorer process. By intercepting specific events (e.g., DocumentComplete) and modifying the HTML structure, they can alter the displayed content.
- **Defense Mechanisms**: Recommended defenses include avoiding Internet Explorer, disabling BHOs, or using tools to list and monitor installed BHOs. Microsoft could also improve security by adding warnings when a BHO modifies a webpage or creating a "Disable BHA" tag for specific pages.
