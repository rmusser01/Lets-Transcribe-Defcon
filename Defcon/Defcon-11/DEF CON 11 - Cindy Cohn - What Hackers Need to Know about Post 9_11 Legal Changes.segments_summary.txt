- Cindy Cohen, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), discusses legal changes affecting hackers since the September 11th attacks and provides an overview of relevant laws.
- The USA Patriot Act, passed shortly after the attacks, includes provisions that impact computer hacking offenses and expand government surveillance powers.
- The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) is the primary federal hacking law, making it illegal to exceed authorized access on a protected computer and cause more than $5,000 in damage. Protected computers include any connected to the Internet or used by the government.
- The Patriot Act expanded wiretap authority, lowered the threshold for prosecution, increased penalties, and allowed aggregation of damages across multiple computers.
- Computer crimes can now be considered terrorist offenses under certain conditions, leading to enhanced punishments such as asset seizure and longer statute of limitations.
- The Patriot Act also introduced or expanded provisions for material support to terrorism, administrative subpoenas, and national security letters, raising concerns about government overreach.
- Jurisdiction for hacking offenses has been extended to non-citizens and those acting outside the U.S. if the effects are felt within the country.
- EFF recommends practicing good cybersecurity hygiene, such as using encryption, protecting anonymity, and minimizing data retention to reduce potential legal risks.
- EFF offers resources and assistance to individuals facing legal issues related to hacking or digital rights.
- The speaker encourages attendees to get involved, stay informed, and advocate for the protection of civil liberties and digital rights.
