- Introduction: Brett Nielsen, an IT security professional and author of a wireless security book, presents a proof-of-concept on malicious code in wireless networks.
- Wireless Technology Overview: Wireless refers to having no wires, with basic components being a transmitter, receiver, and antenna. Various technologies use wireless, including TVs, radios, satellites, mobile devices, and security systems.
- Cellular Technologies: A brief history of cellular generations (1G-3G) is provided, highlighting improvements in data speeds and features like text messaging, email, and live video.
- 802.11 Networks and Wireless Devices: Popular wireless networking standard with various devices like PDAs, converged devices (PDA + cell phone), wireless security cameras, and RFID devices.
- Wireless Threats: War driving, data snooping, jamming, insertion attacks, and unauthorized clients/APs are discussed. Malicious code types (viruses, worms, trojans) and their propagation methods are explained.
- Why Malicious Code Spreads on Wireless Networks: Poor protection, increased device power, standardization, and growing connectivity are enablers. Economic impact of infections can be significant, with potential damages including unwanted messages, data loss, network slowdown, and intrusion.
- Need for Proactive Security: Protection should be implemented at every point, with mobile operators offering scanning services and AV vendors providing solutions. Plans for addressing simultaneous infections are necessary to mitigate potential financial losses.
