- Information Leakage: The unintentional or purposeful release of data that could jeopardize staff, intellectual property, systems, or networks. Successful attacks that go undetected can have serious consequences, and it's important to understand the risks and take measures to protect sensitive information.
- The Art of War: Knowing oneself and the enemy is crucial in information security. Many organizations fail to understand their vulnerabilities, making them susceptible to attacks.
- Technology, People, and Process: While technology is often the focus of security discussions, people and processes are equally important. Simple measures like removing banners from servers, using encryption, and classifying information can enhance security.
- Information Sources: Websites, marketing materials, trade shows, bars, smoking lounges, and organizational parties are common sources of information leakage. Competitive intelligence gathering and social engineering calls can reveal sensitive data.
- Public Records and Databases: Personal and corporate information is easily accessible through public records and databases. It is important to limit the availability of such information and have it removed if necessary.
- Protection Measures: Educating staff, especially corporate officers, about information security is crucial. Performing competitive intelligence on one's own organization can identify vulnerabilities. Classifying information, inserting misinformation, and following security best practices are also recommended.
