- Introduction: The speaker presents X-Prob 2, an open-source remote active operating system fingerprinting tool, and its new version, X-Prob 2 RC1, released with a white paper.
- Context: Active OS fingerprinting tools provide context for IDS systems, vulnerability assessment, and network inventory, aiding security research.
- X-Prob 2 Project: An open-source project with three developers, reflecting their beliefs and ideas, contributing to the security community.
- Previous Versions: The first version was released in 2001, followed by enhancements at DefPoint 10, including FuzzyLogic for matching probe results.
- Active OS Fingerprinting Issues: The speaker discusses the challenges of fingerprinting hardware-based devices, the importance of accurate signature databases, and the impact of environmental effects on probe targets.
- Signature Database Accuracy: Emphasizing the need for a controlled signature database to ensure trust and accuracy, the speaker highlights issues like strict signature matching and the inability to identify underlying platforms.
- Discovery Models: X-Prob 2 introduces new discovery models (TCP ping, UDP ping) and allows users to control which models to use, enhancing flexibility and accuracy.
- TCP-based Fingerprinting Model: A new model based on the TCP 3-way handshake maximizes results and differentiates between Windows and Unix-based systems.
- Port Scanner: The tool includes a port scanner as an independent model, allowing users to specify time intervals between packets to avoid denial-of-service conditions.
- Automatic Receive Timeout Calculation: X-Prob 2 calculates receive timeouts for discovery models, port scanner, and fingerprinting models, adjusting for network conditions.
- Signature Database Rebuild: The signature database has been rebuilt from scratch, tightly controlled, and expanded to include various operating systems and platforms.
- Demo: The speaker demonstrates X-Prob 2's effectiveness by targeting websites in France, showcasing its ability to identify operating systems and adjust scanning tactics.
- Future Enhancements: Plans to implement model dependency, intelligence, and terrain assessment to improve scanning accuracy and differentiate between operating systems.
- Credits and Further Reading: The speaker acknowledges contributors and encourages attendees to refer to the provided documentation for additional information.
