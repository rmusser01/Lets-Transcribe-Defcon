- Kismet 3 is released with new features, including Channel Hopper, improved packet handling, and support for OSX. 
- A vulnerability in Cisco's LEAP (Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol) is discussed, which allows for the deduction of usernames and passwords. A tool called "Asleep" is demonstrated, which exploits this vulnerability. 
- Injection attacks on WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) are presented as an alternative to traditional WEP key-cracking methods. The speaker introduces a proof-of-concept tool called "WepWedgie" that utilizes these injection attacks. 
- A packet creation and injection library for 802.11 is introduced, along with a simple command-line tool called "D-Inject." 
- The speaker discusses future directions for wireless security, including A&G (802.11a and 802.11g) support, analyzing WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II) vulnerabilities, and developing better drivers for injection attacks. 
- Airjack 2 is introduced, which is an OS-independent and bus-independent driver for wireless injection. It supports multiple chipsets and will be released for Linux, BSD, OSX, and Windows. 
- The panel discusses the limitations of current wireless security protocols, such as WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) and 802.11i, and the need for better standardization and stronger authentication methods. 
- The panel answers audience questions on various topics, including the effectiveness of disabling SSID broadcasting, the use of SSL-based security, and the potential of using SIM cards for 802.11 device authentication.
