- **Active Probing:** A method to analyze network performance by sending packets at a rapid rate and observing the responses, providing insights into round-trip delays and network conditions.
- **Round-Trip Delay Analysis:** Examining the time taken for packets to travel between hosts, including small-scale and large-scale events that impact average and peak delays.
- **Research Methodology:** Discusses the use of tools like "time" to measure packet sending intervals, and graphing applications to visualize data, identifying unique characteristics of different router vendors.
- **Router Characteristics:** Examples of delay patterns observed in Foundry, Cisco, and T1-connected routers, indicating the presence of schedulers and management traffic priorities.
- **Congestion Events:** Shark fins and stutter effects observed during congestion events provide insights into queue management and TCP sender behavior.
- **Frequency Analysis:** Using Fourier transforms to analyze network delay, identifying consistent harmonics and distinguishing between host responses, link effects, and queue dynamics.
- **Host and Device Fingerprinting:** Distinct patterns observed in Windows, FreeBSD, and Linux hosts, as well as Cisco routers, suggest the possibility of fingerprinting based on delay variations.
- **Link Bandwidth Estimation:** The rate of decay after a congestion event can indicate the bandwidth of the most constrained link in the path.
- **Future Work:** Access to more diverse equipment and controlled environments is needed to expand the research and create a comprehensive dictionary for host and device identification.
