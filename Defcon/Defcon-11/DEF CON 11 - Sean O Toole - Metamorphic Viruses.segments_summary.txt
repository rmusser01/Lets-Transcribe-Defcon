- Introduction: Sean O'Toole begins by introducing the topic of metamorphic viruses, emphasizing the educational purpose of the conference and the complexity of the subject. He acknowledges the role of the audience as the "computer guys" in their families, often tasked with troubleshooting.
- Definitions and Sections: O'Toole defines metamorphic viruses and outlines six main sections/modules: disassembler, depermutator, shrinker, expander, permutator, and reassembler. Each module is described in detail, including their functions and rarity.
- AI and Software Engineering: Thinking in AI and software engineering is crucial when programming metamorphic viruses. O'Toole emphasizes the importance of modularity and separate functionality to manage complex projects.
- Disassembler: The disassembler module has two choices: creating a pseudo-language for converting code or using reverse engineering tools like LDE and ADE. The disassembler may not be able to reverse-engineer all files, and examples of pseudo-op codes are provided.
- De-permutator: The de-permutator module shuffles and rearranges code. O'Toole presents pseudo-code and explains the variables and processes involved in de-permutation, including jump instructions and label tables.
- Shrinker and Expander: The shrinker module, though rare, simplifies code clusters, while the expander module does the opposite. O'Toole provides pseudo-code examples for both and highlights the importance of randomization in expansion.
- Permutator and Reassembler: The permutator module shuffles code and inserts jumps. The reassembler focuses on fixing jump locations during the reassembly process. O'Toole explains the use of tables to match old and new jump addresses.
- AV Techniques: O'Toole discusses anti-virus (AV) techniques, including signature scans, geometric scanning, and the potential use of shrinkers and de-permutators. He highlights the challenges of detecting metamorphic viruses and the need for new AV approaches.
- Question and Answer: O'Toole opens the floor for questions, addressing topics such as virus size, static parts in metamorphic viruses, AV recognition techniques, unoptimized viruses, behavior blockers, and anti-emulation methods. He recommends reading virus code and exploring websites like zombie's for further reference.
- Conclusion: O'Toole thanks the audience and acknowledges the support of his school, Regis University, in helping fund his trip to the conference.
