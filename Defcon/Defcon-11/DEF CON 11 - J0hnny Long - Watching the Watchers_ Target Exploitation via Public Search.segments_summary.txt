- Introduction: Johnny Long discusses hacking using search engines, specifically Google, to find exploitable or interesting information about websites.
- Using Google as a Transparent Proxy Server: By manipulating the URL, Google Translate can be used as a proxy to browse sites anonymously.
- Finding Development Sites: Google can be used to find corporate or interesting web pages that are not on their intended servers, potentially exposing source code and other sensitive information.
- Bypassing Authentication: Google's caching feature can be used to bypass authentication mechanisms and access restricted areas of websites.
- Finding Exploitable Files and Directories: Specific search terms and phrases can be used to find vulnerable files and directories on web servers, such as bash history files, error messages, and CGI scripts.
- Automating the Process: CGI scanners can be used to automate the process of finding vulnerable servers by stealing their list of vulnerable CGI scripts and searching for them on Google.
- "Google Dorks": The term refers to people who inadvertently expose sensitive information about their sites through Google, often due to poor security configurations.
- Taking Action: While Google is not at fault, individuals and organizations should be proactive in securing their sites and using similar techniques to identify vulnerabilities.
- Examples: Live examples are provided, demonstrating how specific Google searches can reveal sensitive information such as password files, Excel spreadsheets with personal data, and database credentials.
- Conclusion: Johnny encourages attendees to visit his website for more information and provides links to other researchers working in this field.
