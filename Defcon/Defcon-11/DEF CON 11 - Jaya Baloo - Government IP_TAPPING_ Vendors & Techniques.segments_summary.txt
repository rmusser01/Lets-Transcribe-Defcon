- Lawful Interception: The process of legally monitoring and collecting an individual's communications data (e.g. internet, email) by a network operator or service provider, based on a warrant from law enforcement.
- Speaker's Background: The speaker is a freelance consultant in the field of interception, helping set up tapping systems for IP and email interception.
- Arguments for Interception: Terrorism, pedophilia, cyber-stalking, data theft, and drug dealing are common justifications for lawful interception.
- Challenges and Issues: Digital evidence may not always be admissible in court, and it can be difficult to link it to an individual. Maintaining transparency and accuracy in interception is challenging, especially with complex software and varying protocols.
- Interception Vendors: The speaker discusses several vendors and their products for lawful interception, including Verint (Converse InfoSys), Nice, ADC and SS8, Acurus, and Pine.
- Cost and Responsibility: The capital expenditure for interception solutions falls on ISPs, while the government covers operational costs. The cost of such solutions can range from $100,000 to $700,000.
- Future Developments: Lawful interception will become a requirement for joining the EU, and data retention decisions are still being worked on. Borderless interception capabilities and the expansion of ISP roles are also potential future developments.
