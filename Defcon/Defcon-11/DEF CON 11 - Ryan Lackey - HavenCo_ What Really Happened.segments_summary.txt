- HavenCo was a data haven, data hosting services company, founded in 2000 to operate from Sealand, a self-declared unrecognized principality that occupied Roughs Tower. 
- The company was founded by Ryan Lackey, Sean Hastings, Jo Hastings, Avi Freedman, and Sameer Parekh. 
- HavenCo was hailed as potentially revolutionary, offering an "offshore, almost-anything-goes electronic data haven". 
- The company struggled with disorganisation, technical issues, and the dot-com bubble bursting. 
- Ryan Lackey left the company in 2002, citing disagreements with the Bates family, who owned Sealand. 
- HavenCo's website went offline in 2008, and the company ceased operations in 2013. 
- In 2013, Avi Freedman announced plans to relaunch HavenCo, offering proxies, VPNs, and other services using servers in the US and EU, with cold data stored in Sealand.
