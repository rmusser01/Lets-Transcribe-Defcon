- Introduction: Greg Conti introduces himself and his background, including his experience teaching computer science at West Point. He acknowledges the organizers of the event and mentions that his presentation will focus on interface design for hacking tools.
- Command Line vs. GUI: Conti acknowledges the ongoing debate between proponents of command-line interfaces and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). He emphasizes that both have their advantages and that the choice depends on the target audience and the specific application.
- User-Centric Design: Conti stresses the importance of considering the user when designing an interface. He suggests starting with the tasks that users need to accomplish and then tailoring the interface to match their skills and expectations.
- Basic Design Principles: He covers fundamental design principles, including cognitive science, consistency, metaphor, information visualization, and the use of colors, fonts, and labels.
- GUI Components: Conti provides guidelines for using various GUI components, such as radio buttons, checkboxes, dialog boxes, menus, text fields, and icons. He emphasizes the importance of layout and alignment to create a logical flow for the user.
- Example Redesigns and Critiques: Conti presents redesigns of several hacking tools, including Win Nuke, NetBus, and Sub Seven, focusing on simplifying the interface and improving usability. He also critiques other tools, such as SuperScan and Zone Alarm, highlighting areas where the interface could be improved.
- Recommended Resources: Conti provides a list of books and websites that offer valuable insights into interface design, including "GUI Bloopers" by Jeff Johnson, "The Humane Interface" by Raskin, and "Web Pages That Suck" by Flanders and Willis.
- Q&A: Conti answers questions from the audience, addressing topics such as hiding advanced options, colorblindness, localization, and user testing during the design process.
