- Introduction: The presenter introduces the topic of reverse engineering mobile binaries and EXC files on the Pocket PC platform, with a focus on the ARM processor.
- Book Giveaway: The presenter gives away copies of a book they co-authored to audience members with the brightest shirt, the oldest person, and someone who can understand traditional Chinese.
- Legal Issues: The presenter covers legal aspects, noting that reverse engineering can be illegal in some contexts. They provide a self-made serial program to avoid legal issues.
- Serial Protection: The presenter demonstrates how to program serial protection effectively, highlighting common flaws in upper-level languages.
- Memory and File Storage: A unique issue with the Pocket PC platform is discussed, where OS files are stored in ROM and executed in place, while other files are stored in RAM and can be lost if power runs out.
- Prerequisites for Reverse Engineering: Understanding assembly, conversions between hex, binary, and decimal, and specifics of the ARM processor, such as registers and op-codes, are essential prerequisites.
- Registers and Op-Codes: The presenter provides an overview of important registers and op-codes, including the program counter, link register, stack pointer, and status flags.
- Tools for Reverse Engineering: Hex editor, disassembler, and debugger are the three main tools used for reverse engineering, each serving a specific purpose in the process.
- Demonstration of Reverse Engineering: The presenter uses IDA Pro to locate a serial validation check in a program and then employs a debugger to step through the code, manipulating register values to bypass the check.
- Cracking Techniques: Three different methods for cracking the program are demonstrated, including sleight of hand, virtual NOP, and loading the correct serial number directly into a register.
- Code Example: The presenter shares the code used in the demonstration, highlighting common mistakes to avoid.
- Applications of Reverse Engineering: Beyond cracking, reverse engineering can be used to modify programs to suit personal preferences or enable undocumented features, such as connecting to non-default ports.
- Resources: A list of websites and PDFs are provided as resources for further learning and reference.
