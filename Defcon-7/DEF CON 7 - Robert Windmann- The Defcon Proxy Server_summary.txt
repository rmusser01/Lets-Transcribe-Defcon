The paid membership will include additional features and an @DefCon.net email address. The speaker emphasizes the importance of anonymity during the sign-up process and addresses potential challenges for international users. The new domain, DefConNet, is announced, along with a planned rollout date. A Q&A session concludes the presentation.
