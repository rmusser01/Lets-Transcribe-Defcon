In this talk, Jonathan Wignall discusses the vulnerabilities of companies' web presence and offers strategies for protection. He emphasizes that companies often focus solely on hardening their internal systems while neglecting their internet presence. He suggests that companies are susceptible to attacks on their websites, domain names, search engine optimization, and email communications. Wignall recommends registering multiple domain names, monitoring newsgroups and search engines, and using digital signatures to protect against these threats. Additionally, he highlights the potential for internet service providers to be compromised, leading to sniffing, DNS analysis, and denial-of-service attacks. He concludes by encouraging a proactive approach to security beyond traditional firewalls and fortress models.
