The speaker, Dead Addict, presents an overview of currency systems, credit systems, and their associations, with a focus on the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol. He begins by discussing the history of currency and fraud, highlighting the increased fraud risk with paper currency compared to gold. He then explains how banks create money and the credit system, including the roles of card associations like Visa. Addict introduces SET, a protocol designed by card associations specifically for credit card transactions. He addresses the chicken-and-egg problem of SET implementation and predicts increased adoption after Y2K. Addict compares SET to SSL, emphasizing SET's end-to-end security and the importance of interoperability among software vendors. He explains the roles of the four components in SET: certificate authority, wallet, point-of-sale, and gateway. Addict describes the transaction process and highlights the non-repudiation factor, which elevates Internet transactions to the level of face-to-face transactions. He concludes by answering questions about SET's limitations, certificate issuance, fraud prevention, and future developments.
