At the 1999 DEF CON convention in Las Vegas, Professor Fiedelbaum, founder of Desert Crossing radio broadcast and Voice of Mercury, presents on micropower radio. Fiedelbaum covers legal changes, antenna construction, and building a pirate radio station. The FCC is considering legalizing micropower radio and has proposed licensing for low-power FM stations. Fiedelbaum discusses transmitter and antenna options, offers resources for technical assistance, and explains how people get caught operating pirate stations. Consequences for illegal broadcasting can include equipment confiscation and significant fines. Fiedelbaum concludes by addressing questions about FCC laws and licensing for low-power AM and FM broadcasting.
