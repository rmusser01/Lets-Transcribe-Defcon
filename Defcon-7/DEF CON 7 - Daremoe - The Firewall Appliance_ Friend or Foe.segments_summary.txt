- Introduction: The speakers introduce themselves and provide an overview of the talk, which will cover the results of a comprehensive review of 23 appliance firewalls.
- Definition of Appliance Firewall: The speakers discuss the definition of an appliance firewall and how it differs from vendor definitions. They emphasize the importance of easy deployment and dual-home network access.
- Types of Appliance Firewalls: Most of the reviewed firewalls are packet-filtering technologies with access control lists. Some use stateful inspection or application proxies, and all perform network address translation (NAT).
- Features: DHCP support, port and address redirection, DMZ deployment, offloading of logging, and alerting via email, paging, and SNMP are among the features offered by the firewalls.
- Identification: High ports (>1024) being open or filtered, web server banners, SSH identification, and NMAP/CASO scans can help identify the type of appliance firewall in use.
- Weaknesses: The speakers discuss various weaknesses in appliance firewalls, including limited logging, possible holes in filtering rules, DNS problems, address spoofing, session hijacking, and exposure of internal systems.
- Exploitation: They provide examples of how to exploit these weaknesses, including using Netcat, Firewalk, and NMAP to discover and target internal systems.
- Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: The speakers discuss the effectiveness of various DoS attacks against appliance firewalls, including flooding, bandwidth socket attacks, and protocol-specific attacks.
- Management and Misconfiguration: Some appliance firewalls allow remote management, which can be a security risk. Misconfiguration of rules and interfaces is also a common issue.
- Testing and Resources: The speakers provide advice on testing appliance firewalls and recommend resources for further information, including a white paper and security websites.
- Q&A: The speakers answer questions from the audience, including inquiries about specific firewall brands, pricing, ICSA certification, and the potential for future reviews.
