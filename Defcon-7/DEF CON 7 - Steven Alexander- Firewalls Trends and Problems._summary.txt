The DEF CON 7 convention in Las Vegas in 1999 included talks on firewall trends and problems, and methods to circumvent censorship and blocking software. Steven Alexander's talk on firewalls highlighted their limitations and the need for additional security measures. He discussed the importance of proper firewall management, the challenges posed by new services and protocols, and the risks of remote administration. He also addressed the integration of VPNs and the use of demilitarized zones. Bennett Hazleton's presentation focused on censorship and blocking software, particularly in schools and libraries. He discussed the politics behind these tools and how they determine blocked websites. Hazleton also provided techniques to circumvent such software, including the use of proxy servers and mirror sites. He presented a mathematical model to optimize the distribution of mirror sites while minimizing the impact of spies.
