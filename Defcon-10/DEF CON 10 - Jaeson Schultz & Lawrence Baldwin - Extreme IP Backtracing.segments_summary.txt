- **Introduction**: Lawrence Baldwin, developer of Minet Watchman, an intrusion detection system, discusses the challenges of IP back tracing and the importance of analyzing firewall logs to improve internet security.
- **Validating Source IP**: Before back tracing, validate the source IP to ensure the traffic is coming from a remote physical interface and not generated locally or from a neighboring network.
- **Excluding Invalid IPs**: Exclude Martian addresses, private addresses, and IANA reserved addresses as they are unlikely to be the source of attacks.
- **Spoof Detection**: Detecting IP spoofing is difficult, but techniques like passive fingerprinting (analyzing TTL values) and route validation using BGP route tables can provide insights into the legitimacy of the source IP.
- **Basic Back Tracing Tools**: NS Lookup and Who Is databases are standard tools for back tracing. Contact information in Who Is records may be outdated or misleading, so cross-checking with domain-based Who Is queries is recommended.
- **Intermediate Back Tracing**: Recursive Who Is lookups and cross-referencing IP and domain Who Is information can help identify the domain responsible for the IP address.
- **Advanced Back Tracing**: Searching domain names and addresses in Google, using referral Who Is, and checking routing registries can provide additional information.
- **Extreme Back Tracing**: Analyzing open ports, SSL certificates, and machine names can provide clues about the owner. Sending NetSend messages or contacting the autonomous system owner may be necessary in some cases.
- **Conclusion**: Many corporations have an isolationist view of the internet, focusing on internal security. However, compromised machines within their networks can be used for DDoS attacks. Reading and analyzing firewall logs, and utilizing services like Minet Watchman and D-Shield, can help identify and address these issues.
