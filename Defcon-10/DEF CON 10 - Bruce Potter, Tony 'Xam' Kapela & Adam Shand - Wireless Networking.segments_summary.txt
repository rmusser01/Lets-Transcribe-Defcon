- Wireless Security: The presentation discusses various aspects of wireless security, including access point (AP) management, open-source vs. commercial APs, association issues, and the risks associated with unsecured networks.
- Open-Source vs. Commercial APs: Zam highlights the limitations of commercial APs, such as lack of secure management and vendor support. Open-source APs offer more flexibility, better security, and the ability to run multiple protocols.
- Association Issues: Over-association can cause APs to behave unpredictably. De-authentication frames can be used to knock stations off an AP, allowing an attacker to take over their MAC address.
- Bruce Pott's Perspective: Bruce emphasizes the importance of securing clients rather than just the infrastructure. He discusses the risks of using new wireless gear, the localized nature of wireless attacks, and the value of using encryption protocols like WPA.
- 802.1X and EAP: Bruce explains the limitations of 802.1X in wireless networks and how WPA can mitigate some of its issues. He also mentions the importance of key management and the need for a secure initial association.
- Application-Level Security: Adam Shand mentions various application-level security measures, including captive portals, authenticated DHCP, and extrusion detection.
- Community Wireless Networking: Adam describes different types of community wireless groups and their goals. The ultimate dream is to build a wireless cloud that enables free exchange of information.
- Digital Commons and Security Challenges: Building a digital commons requires decentralization and distribution of ownership. Securing such a network is challenging due to a lack of physical security and control over hardware. Solving these problems is crucial for the network to reach critical mass.
