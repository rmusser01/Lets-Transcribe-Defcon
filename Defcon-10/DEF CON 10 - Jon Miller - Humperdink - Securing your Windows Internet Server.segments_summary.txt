- Introduction: Humperdink (John Miller), a senior security engineer at Covert Systems, will discuss securing Windows Internet servers, emphasizing good fundamentals and common sense.
- Upgrading and Installation: Avoid upgrading from NT4 to Windows 2000 due to security issues; always perform a fresh install or use a ghost image.
- File Systems: Always use NTFS for better file permissions; FAT is insecure.
- Service Packs and Updates: Keep servers up to date with the latest service packs; use tools like HFNet Check to identify missing hotfixes.
- Remote Administration: Decide on a remote administration tool (e.g., V-shell, Compact Remote Insight Manager) before installing the server; disable unnecessary services and protocols.
- Network Configuration: Isolate IIS servers on a separate network; use TCP/IP filtering to restrict traffic to required ports (e.g., 22 and 80); regularly scan and map servers to identify unexpected ports.
- IIS Server Placement: Place IIS servers in a DMZ with restricted access to the corporate domain; consider using multiple network cards for added security.
- MMC and Security Templates: Utilize the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for server management; create custom security templates to standardize server configurations.
- Password Complexity and Account Management: Enforce strong password policies and regular expiration; rename or disable the default administrator account to reduce vulnerability to brute-force attacks.
- Service and Script Management: Remove unnecessary services and scripts (e.g., TFTP, IIS admin password, sample files, script mappings) to reduce potential attack vectors.
- Partitioning and File Permissions: Separate web content from system files on different partitions; restrict permissions on IIS log files and other sensitive data.
- Exchange Server Security: Disable open relaying to prevent spamming; use encrypted file systems and antivirus software; consider using a front-end/back-end architecture for added security.
- Tools for Security: Utilize tools like URLScan, Baseline Security Analyzer, IIS Lockdown Tool, SecureIIS, Tripwire for NT, and antivirus software to enhance server security.
- Conclusion: Emphasizes the importance of following best practices and seeking professional help if needed.
