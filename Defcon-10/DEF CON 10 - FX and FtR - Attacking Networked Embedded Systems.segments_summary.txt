- The presenters, FX and FTR, from Fenalate, discuss attacking networked embedded systems, including design failures, software vulnerabilities, and provide a tutorial on rooting a Cisco device.
- FTR defines an embedded system as a small computer device running a custom OS, used for a specific job, often with network connectivity.
- Common problems with embedded systems include undocumented functionalities, backdoors left by developers, auto-configuration features, and rushed development due to marketing demands, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.
- Examples of devices with vulnerabilities include Lozen Brick firewalls, ARCEN routers, and HP printers.
- FX and FTR have developed tools to exploit vulnerabilities in HP printers, allowing access to the file system, environment variables, and the ability to upload and execute new services.
- Software vulnerabilities in embedded systems are similar to those in Windows and Unix, including input validation issues, format strings, buffer overflows, and cross-site scripting.
- FX and FTR demonstrate how to exploit a memory corruption vulnerability in Cisco routers by overflowing a buffer and manipulating memory blocks to gain control of the device.
- They emphasize the importance of mixed vendor solutions and router hardening to mitigate the impact of potential exploits.
