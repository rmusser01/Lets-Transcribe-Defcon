- Introduction: Ilanka Dunnan, a game designer and manager at Play.net, presents an overview of steganography and its potential use by Al-Qaeda to hide messages in images.
- Background: Dunnan's expertise in cryptography stems from solving puzzle challenges and her involvement in the hacker subculture. She emphasizes the difference between steganography (concealment) and other types of ciphers (substitution and transposition).
- Al-Qaeda and Steganography: Despite rumors and media speculation, there is no evidence that Al-Qaeda used steganography to hide messages in web images, according to Dunnan's research and conversations with experts.
- Definition and Examples of Steganography: Steganography is a method of hiding messages so that the presence of a hidden message is not immediately obvious. Examples include simple letter substitution, invisible ink, and pinprick messages in newspapers.
- Modern Steganography: Messages can be concealed in various digital formats, including images, audio files, videos, and web page text. Dunnan demonstrates how a hidden message can be embedded in an image using steganographic software, altering the color palette and file size.
- Detection, Decryption, and Destruction: Steganalysis tools can detect potential steganography by analyzing image palettes, file sizes, and modification dates. Decryption can be achieved through password acquisition or dictionary attacks. Destruction involves modifying the image to remove hidden data.
- Examples and Applications: Dunnan presents her own steganographic code challenge, "The Alonka Code," and provides examples of steganography on her personal website. She also mentions potential future applications, such as watermarking and embedding physician's notes in X-rays.
- Summary and Contact: Steganography is a challenging but not impossible technique to detect. Dunnan recommends Peter Wainer's book, "Disappearing Cryptography," as a resource. She provides contact information and offers additional reading materials.
