- Introduction: The panel discusses responsible disclosure of vulnerability information, aiming to find a middle ground between dumping information online and corporate secrecy.
- Panelist Introductions: Dick Schaefer (NSA), Marcus Sacks (White House), Sammy Sagerie (Strategic Research Institute), Martin Linder (CERT Coordination Center), and Tom Parker (Global Intersec) offer their expertise.
- Definition of Responsible Disclosure: Panelists agree it involves protecting critical information while also presenting vulnerabilities to foster a "cyber immune response."
- Threats of Irresponsibility: The increasing interconnectedness of systems and the rise of script kiddies highlight the need for responsible disclosure to prevent malicious attacks.
- Working Together: Collaboration between communities is key, and an ideal disclosure model depends on understanding researchers' interests, evaluating costs/benefits, and setting integrity standards.
- Company Responsibility: Software vendors' lack of liability and poor-quality products are criticized. The panel encourages users to demand better and push for fixes.
- Black Hole of Information: Panelists discuss the frustration of researchers when vulnerabilities seem to disappear, and suggest documenting workarounds or not using unsupported software.
- Bug Disclosure Timing: The panel agrees that a reasonable amount of time should be given to vendors to fix vulnerabilities before public disclosure, but recognizes the challenge of defining "quick."
- Whistleblower Protection: The idea of federal whistleblower protection for researchers who disclose vulnerabilities is floated, but no ongoing efforts are known.
- Global Impact: The U.S. is seen as a leader in cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection, and the panel emphasizes the importance of setting a positive example for responsible disclosure worldwide.
