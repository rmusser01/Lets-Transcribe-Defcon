- Stealth Data Dispersion: The presenter discusses a technique to securely hide small amounts of data by dispersing it across multiple nodes on a network, ensuring data survival even if some nodes are removed. This method aims to enhance privacy and prevent data from being stored on any physical device or single location.
- Protocols for Data Dispersion: The presenter explores using existing protocols like Echo Service (TCP/UDP), ICMP echo requests, and multicasting to achieve data dispersion. ICMP is favored due to its universal availability and requirement on all TCP/IP stacks.
- Seeding and Bouncing Phases: The process involves a seeding phase where data is injected into the network, followed by a bouncing phase where it is continuously echoed between hosts. The presenter emphasizes the importance of efficient code to prevent data from being swapped or stored on disks.
- Redundancy and Failure Recovery: By targeting multiple hosts and using redundant seating hosts, the system can recover data even if some hosts are seized or fail. This enhances data security and makes it challenging for law enforcement to access data simultaneously across multiple continents.
- Data Size and Compression: The presenter highlights the importance of keeping data sizes small (less than 1,500 bytes) for effective dispersion. Compression techniques further reduce the required number of packets for storage and transfer.
- Covert Channels and Spoofing: The technique can be combined with covert channels and IP spoofing to transfer data indirectly between hosts, bypassing destination filters in networks.
- Limitations and Security: The presenter acknowledges the possibility of data loss with lossy protocols and the need for careful implementation to avoid data collisions. While the method enhances stealth, it does not guarantee complete security from raw traffic analysis.
