- Introduction: Mike Rogers, a Senior Security Engineer, lectures on steganography and its malicious use. He defines steganography, its history, and its current importance in information security, especially post-9/11.
- Steganography Overview: Rogers explains the components of the stego process, including the cover document, secret message, and stego key. He clarifies that steganography aims to hide data rather than obfuscate it like cryptography. He also mentions the recent trend of combining steganography with cryptography for added security.
- Steganography Protocols: There are three primary protocols: pure steganography (no key exchange required), secret key steganography (similar to symmetric cipher), and public key steganography (based on PKI).
- Steganography Techniques: Rogers outlines six techniques: substitution systems, transform domain techniques, spread spectrum techniques, statistical methods, distortion techniques, and cover generation methodologies. He provides examples and tools for each, emphasizing the ease and popularity of substitution methods.
- Malicious Use of Steganography: Rogers proposes using steganography to distribute malicious code, such as viruses and Trojans. He suggests embedding functioning code into cover objects like AVI files, JPEGs, or MP3s, and then finding ways to extract and execute the code on target machines.
- Distribution and Execution: Rogers describes a scenario where a hacker injects a Trojan into an image on a vulnerable web server. When users download the image, the embedded code executes, giving the hacker access to their machines. He also mentions the development of a "phone home" Trojan that communicates through unblockable ports.
- Commercial Applications: Rogers discusses digital watermarking as a potential commercial application of steganography. By embedding steganographic data, companies can certify the authenticity of objects and track pirated or misused content.
- Q&A: Rogers answers questions about the practicality of his proposed malicious use of steganography, emphasizing that it is still in the early stages of development. He also clarifies the role of AVI file layers and how they can force other events to run, aiding in the execution of embedded code.
