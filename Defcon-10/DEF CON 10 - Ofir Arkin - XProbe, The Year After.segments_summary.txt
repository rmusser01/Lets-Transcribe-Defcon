- Introduction: Ophir Arkin, founder of the Security Group, presents the second version of "expert," a remote active operating system fingerprinting tool.
- Previous Version's Limitations: The first version of "expert" had limitations, including a lack of signature database and static decision tree, which restricted new fingerprint integration.
- New Features: "Expert 2" aims to address these limitations by incorporating signature support, a fuzzy approach to fingerprinting, and API integration for custom tests.
- Mathematical Approach: "Expert 2" utilizes a matrix representation and statistical calculations for scoring, allowing for probabilistic results and handling of yes/no tests.
- Live Demo: Arkin demonstrates "Expert 2" on websites from Iran and China, accurately identifying their operating systems despite potential obstacles like firewalls and load balancers.
- Future Plans: The tool will include a qualmeter for test selection, TCP models, and enhancements to reduce the number of packets sent.
- Acknowledgments: Arkin thanks his colleague, Bender Kijirayev, and encourages users to read the documentation and paper for a deeper understanding of the tool.
