- Operating System Fingerprinting: Discusses methods to detect an operating system (OS) running on a computer, including tests like X, KSO, MAP, and Wing, which analyze network behavior and TCP/IP stack implementation.
- Tools vs. Libraries: Explains the benefits of using a library instead of a tool for OS fingerprinting, allowing customization and integration into existing code.
- Generations of OS Fingerprinting: Describes the evolution of OS fingerprinting, from KSO (1st gen) to X (2nd gen) to X Probe 2 (3rd gen), with improvements in database management and algorithmic decision-making.
- Library Structure: Details the structure of the speaker's OS fingerprinting library, written in C, with Java and C++ wrappers, and plans for Perl and C++ modules.
- OS Classification: Raises the issue of how to classify OS versions and variants, seeking feedback on an effective classification system.
- Threading: Advocates for threaded fingerprinting to improve speed and efficiency by running multiple independent tests simultaneously.
- Future Plans: Includes service fingerprinting, a simple scanner, and an Apache module for dynamic content delivery based on OS detection.
