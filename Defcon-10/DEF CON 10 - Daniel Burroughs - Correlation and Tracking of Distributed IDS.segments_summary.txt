- Introduction: Daniel Burroughs from the Institute for Security Technology Studies at Dartmouth College presents his work on correlating information from distributed intrusion detection systems to analyze network attacks.
- Background: Burroughs provides an overview of the diverse security measures employed by organizations, from basic firewalls to advanced intrusion detection systems (IDS). He highlights the need to reorganize and correlate the vast amount of data generated by these systems to aid security analysts in their work.
- Goals: The primary goals are to detect distributed and coordinated attacks, protect critical infrastructure, and reduce the data overload on security analysts by reorganizing and correlating information from various IDS and network sensors.
- Traditional vs. Proposed Approach: The traditional defensive posture focuses on protecting individual networks, resulting in a limited view of attackers' overall goals. The proposed approach aims to gain a wider perspective by tracking and correlating data from multiple sensors to understand attackers' behaviors and intentions.
- Data Collection and Correlation: Burroughs discusses the use of techniques from radar tracking systems, multiple hypotheses tracking, and machine learning to analyze and correlate data from different IDS and network sensors.
- Modeling Sensors and Attackers: The presentation covers the challenges of modeling sensors (signature and anomaly detection systems) and attackers, including the use of simulations, local networks, and the DEFCON Capture the Flag game data.
- State Problem of the Attack: The challenge of describing the state of an attack due to the nonlinear and non-contiguous nature of the attack space is addressed. A solution is proposed using a windowed history of events to differentiate between attacks.
- Feature Sets and Classification: The importance of selecting the right feature sets (e.g., source IP spread, arrival rate) for differentiating between attack types is emphasized. Machine learning techniques are employed to classify events and separate them into tracks.
- Hypothesis Tracking and Pruning: The system employs a selective branching approach to hypothesis tracking, only branching when necessary. Pruning techniques are used to reduce the number of hypotheses and computational workload.
- Testing and Evaluation: Burroughs presents results from testing the system on data from the Thayer and ISTS networks, as well as DEFCON data sets, achieving up to 95% accuracy in scenario placement.
- Future Work: Plans to incorporate data from additional sensors, host-based IDS system logs, and integration with other network analysis tools are discussed.
- Conclusion: The system aims to provide a higher-level view of network attacks, reduce the workload on security analysts, and improve the overall security posture. Ongoing and future work includes incorporating diverse sensor data, improving false positive rates, and integrating with other ISTS projects.
