- Introduction: The speaker provides an overview of the talk, which will cover a contract with a large ISP to test and evaluate solutions for Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
- Background: The ISP had recently suffered from DoS/DDoS attacks and needed to evaluate emerging technologies for protection. The speaker also mentions the ease of access to tools for launching such attacks and the increasing severity of the problem.
- Goals: The ISP sought a solution that could protect their infrastructure, data, and business continuity. The speaker's team was tasked with finding a solution that could work at the gigabit and multi-mode fiber levels and could scale up to OC-48 and OC-192 standards.
- Tested Products: The team tested passive tap solutions (Arbor Networks, Reactive Networks, Mazu Networks, and Asta Networks) and inline solutions (Captus Networks and Mazu Networks). The vendors were supportive and provided feedback during the testing process.
- Methodology: The team set up a lab environment mimicking a customer hosting center to conduct real-world tests. They evaluated both the network functionality and management aspects of the products. The lab included attack boxes to simulate various DoS/DDoS scenarios and victim computers to assess the impact.
- Test Environment: The speaker provides a diagram of the test environment, explaining the placement of attack boxes, victim computers, and network equipment from Cisco and Juniper. They also mention the use of port mirroring to facilitate multiple product tests simultaneously.
- Passive Tap Solutions: The speaker describes the setup and functionality of the passive tap solutions tested, including data profiling, traffic profiling, and alarm/filter recommendation features.
- Inline Solutions: The speaker discusses the advantages and concerns of inline solutions, including their quicker response time but potential for being a single point of failure. The ISP preferred manual review and control over any automatic implementations.
- Lessons Learned: The speaker shares insights gained during the testing process, such as the importance of proper baseline traffic setup, controlling the lab environment, and separating management networks to avoid unintended disruptions.
- Vendor Performance: The speaker provides an overview of how the vendors performed in the tests, noting their ability to monitor baseline traffic, detect changes, and alert/alarm when thresholds were exceeded. However, protection of management interfaces needed improvement, as some products locked up under attack.
- Recommendations: For large enterprises, the speaker recommends passive solutions, citing the need for a mix of flow and packet collectors, and centralizing management consoles. Arbor, Asta, and Reactive Networks are suggested as viable options. For smaller enterprises, inline solutions like Captus and Mazu are worth considering, with potential integration into firewalls or IDS solutions.
- Costs and Scalability: The speaker mentions the high cost of the Arbor solution ($10-12 million for the ISP's entire network) but notes that it was the most mature and feature-rich. Costs have changed since the tests, and scalability options vary among vendors.
- Q&A: The speaker answers questions about specific aspects of the tests, such as utilization rates, frame sizes, spoofed addresses, and the impact of shutting down a box. They also discuss ACL limitations on Cisco routers and the potential of reverse path filtering as a protective measure.
