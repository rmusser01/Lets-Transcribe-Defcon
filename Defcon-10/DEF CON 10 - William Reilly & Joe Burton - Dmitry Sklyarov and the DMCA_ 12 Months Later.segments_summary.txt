- Introduction: Joe Burton, a lawyer, and Bill Riley, a young lawyer, discuss the Elcomsoft case and related legal issues.
- Elcomsoft Case: Dimitri Sklyarov, an Elcomsoft employee, was arrested in the U.S. for presenting a tool to decrypt PDF files at DefCon. Burton and Riley were his lawyers. They highlight the case's importance in setting a standard for legitimate software development and user activities, especially regarding copyright protection.
- DMCA Interpretation: The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is interpreted and applied too broadly, threatening software developers and users with legal consequences for legitimate activities. The case aims to clarify and narrow the interpretation.
- Extraterritoriality: Burton discusses the challenge of defining jurisdiction in cyberspace, arguing that current interpretations favor the U.S. government's ability to charge individuals for activities involving U.S.-based computers.
- Due Process and Vagueness: A motion regarding due process and the vagueness of the statute was raised, questioning the liability of tool creators when their tools can be used for both good and bad purposes.
- Trial Update: The trial is set for August 26, and Burton expresses confidence in their case, despite losing some preliminary motions.
- DMCA Provisions: Riley explains the two types of software code provisions in the DMCA: access controls (preventing access to underlying code) and copy controls (preventing distribution of underlying code).
- Website and Company Factors: Factors that U.S. attorneys and the FBI consider when prosecuting cases include server location, website tone, contact information, meta tags, declarations/warnings, software location, credit card processors, and correspondence.
- New Legislation: Bills such as the Patriot Act, H.R. 3482 (life sentences for hacking), the European Cybercrime Treaty, and the Hollings bill (requiring hardware copy protection) are discussed for their potential impact on digital rights and network security.
- Jurisdiction and Enforcement: The conversation turns to the jurisdiction of U.S. laws for U.S. citizens committing acts outside the country and foreigners committing acts that are legal in their country but illegal in the U.S.
