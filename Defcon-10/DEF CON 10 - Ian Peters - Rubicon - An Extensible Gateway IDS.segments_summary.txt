- Introduction: Ian Peters introduces his final year degree project, Rubicon, an integrated firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS). He mentions the inspiration for the project and the challenges faced, including academic preferences for algorithms over products and issues with backups.
- Background: Peters provides a brief overview of firewalls, their limitations, and the need for intrusion detection. He mentions the issues of false positives and negatives and the inability of traditional signature-based methods to detect new attacks.
- Integration of Firewall and IDS: Peters discusses the benefits of integrating a firewall and IDS, including the ability to automatically block attacks without human intervention. He mentions different ways of integration and the advantages of a fully integrated bespoke solution.
- Current State and Problems: Peters notes that academia doesn't seem interested in product development, especially in the UK. He highlights the fast-moving nature of IDS development and the challenges of integration, including false positives, denial of service, and processing power requirements.
- Design and Functionality: Peters explains the modular design of Rubicon, which allows for easy modification and the addition of new protocols. He provides examples of how Rubicon can reroute attacks to a honeynet and modify packets to remove malicious payloads.
- Plugins and Features: Peters describes the various plugins available for Rubicon, including input, output, analysis, and protocol plugins. He mentions the use of snort's matching algorithm and the ability to include snort rules in the XML policy. Other features include counter, defragmentation, logging, and packet modification.
- Conclusions and Future Work: Peters mentions the lack of benchmarks due to a code review but shares positive results from initial testing. He acknowledges the need for uptake and testing by the community. Future work includes improving bug fixes, adding host-based intrusion detection, and exploring quality of service and load balancing capabilities.
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Peters offers his conclusions on IDS, emphasizing the need to reduce false positives, detect new attacks, and improve standardization. He also highlights the importance of host-based intrusion detection and secure IDS implementations.
