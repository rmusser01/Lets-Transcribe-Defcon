- Introduction to computer viruses: Different types, how they work, how to remove them, and how to protect against them.
- Malicious code: Defined as any program or script that executes without the user's permission, including worms and Trojans.
- Computer viruses: Self-replicating code that attaches to a host, such as floppy boot records, master boot records, or binary files.
- Boot sector viruses: How they work, what to look for, and ways to remove them. Examples include Monkey and Music.
- File infector viruses: Point to the end of a file and the beginning of the virus code, increasing file size.
- Macro viruses: Use basic computer language in Word and Excel, often replacing the "normal.dot" file to infect new documents.
- Trojan horses: Appear legitimate but have hidden malicious purposes. Examples include Whack-a-Mole and backdoor programs like BO2K.
- Virus evolution: New methods are emerging, such as polymorphic and metamorphic viruses, making detection and removal more difficult.
- Fakes and false alarms: Spread through email, often containing excessive punctuation and all-caps text.
- VBS scripts: Allow anyone to write viruses, such as the "I Love You" virus.
- Protecting against hostile code: Use sandbox technology and set security settings. Unique systems are not 100% safe.
- Future threats: Viruses may look for new exploits and target secret FTP servers.
