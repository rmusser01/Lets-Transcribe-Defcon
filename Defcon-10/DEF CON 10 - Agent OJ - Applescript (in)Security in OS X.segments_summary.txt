- AppleScript is a powerful tool with potential benefits and risks: it can be used for system maintenance, checking processes, listing users, and more, but it can also be exploited for malicious purposes if scriptable applications are not secure. 
- In the past, AppleScript Trojans/viruses have measured system information and tampered with files, exploiting scriptable applications.
- OS10's integration with AppleScript and the increasing number of scriptable programs create more potential exploits.
- AppleScript can be used defensively to check/kill processes, list applications, and display users.
- Best practices include verifying downloaded files, changing permissions, and being cautious with compiled scripts.
- AppleScript can run shell scripts, access dictionaries, and interact with multiple applications, posing security risks if not properly secured.
- The OS10 server version and enabling AppleScript can introduce vulnerabilities, especially with certain services running.
- AppleScript can be embedded in emails as attachments and executed upon receipt, but not directly embedded in the email body.
- Remote Apple Events, if enabled, can be a security issue as they allow users to send Apple Events to the computer.
