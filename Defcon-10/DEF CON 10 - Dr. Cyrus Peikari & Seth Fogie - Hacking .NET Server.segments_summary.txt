- Introduction: The speakers, Cyrus Picari and Seth Fogi, introduce themselves and their book on Windows .NET server security, which has been pirated and translated into Chinese. They also mention that they will be giving away some hardware and that their slides and paper are available online and on the conference CD.
- Windows .NET Server: .NET Server is the next version of Windows 2000, re-engineered from the Windows 2000 codebase. It has been delayed several times due to security concerns and is expected to be released in mid-2003 or early 2003.
- Windows Product Activation (WPA): WPA is an anti-piracy scheme introduced in XP that takes a hash of a machine's specifications to generate an activation key. It has privacy concerns due to its association with the Business Software Alliance (BSA), a hired anti-piracy enforcer for Microsoft and other large software companies.
- Kerberos Authentication: Kerberos is a network authentication protocol designed at MIT in the 1980s. A potential attack against Kerberos was demonstrated by Franco Dwyer, involving sniffing a login session and brute-force cracking the password.
- Remote Assistance: Remote assistance allows users to get help from technical experts. .NET Server relays remote assistance requests through Microsoft's website, raising privacy concerns. The password is optional, and the request can be intercepted by attackers, allowing them to gain control of the user's computer.
- Remote Desktop: Remote desktop allows users to remotely control a computer. It runs on a dedicated port, making it vulnerable to port scanning and brute-force attacks. It is disabled by default but can be enabled, granting full access to the computer.
- Wireless Networking: .NET Server supports wireless networking and WEP (Wired Equivalency Privacy) encryption. However, WEP is crackable, and war driving makes it easy for attackers to find open ports. RC4 algorithm and initialization vector collisions weaken WEP, and tools exist to crack it within a few hours.
- Microsoft Policies: The speakers discuss Microsoft's termination of the Microsoft Security Partners Program (MSPP) and the introduction of the Gold Certified Partner for Security Solutions (CPSS), which favors larger companies and requires a gag rule on vulnerability disclosures. They recommend immediate removal of WPA and termination of association with BSA to improve Microsoft's security perception.
