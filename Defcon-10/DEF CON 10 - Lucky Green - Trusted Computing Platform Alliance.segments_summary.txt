- The Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA) is a group of major tech companies that aims to prevent the use of unlicensed software and digital content through technical and legal means.
- TCPA plans to add a "Fritz chip" to all future motherboards, which will restrict user access and enable remote monitoring and control.
- The Fritz chip will have three levels of access: privileged (for TCPA members), underprivileged (for users), and unprivileged (for untrusted code).
- TCPA includes companies like Intel, Microsoft, HP, Compaq, IBM, AMD, Motorola, and security firms like VeriSign and RSA Security.
- The Fritz chip will enable remote challengers to verify the state of a user's computer, ensuring compliance with licensing and preventing unauthorized access or modifications.
- TCPA also aims to defeat the GPL (General Public License) by making open-source software incompatible with their hardware.
- TCPA enables information validation and facilitates intelligence collection and law enforcement by providing undeniable proof of document authorship and tracking.
- Senator Fritz Hollings has proposed a bill to make TCPA-compliant computers mandatory, with harsh penalties for non-compliance.
- Microsoft's Palladium initiative is a variant of TCPA, adding a new mode to the CPU that restricts access to ring zero (supervisor mode).
- TCPA and Palladium face technical challenges and opposition, but their broad industry support increases the likelihood of success.
