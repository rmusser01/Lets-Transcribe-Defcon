- Introduction: Matthew Marsh introduces himself and provides an overview of the topics he will cover, including SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) and its evolution from version 1 to version 3.
- SNMP Overview: SNMP is a message-passing protocol designed for data transfers between managed devices. SNMPv1 had security vulnerabilities and lacked built-in authentication, authorization, and privacy features. SNMPv2 introduced improvements but was proprietary. SNMPv3 adds authentication, privacy (encryption), and informed traps (acknowledged by the manager).
- Definitions: ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation 1) is used to specify data points in MIBs (Management Information Base). MIBs define data structures and can be used for device management. Authorization and authentication are important for secure SNMP communication.
- SNMPv3 Highlights: SNMPv3 supports multiple security structures, users, and access control. It offers improved privacy and encryption options. Custom applications can utilize various encryption algorithms. SNMP is a versatile message-passing protocol.
- NetSNMP: NetSNMP is an open-source implementation of SNMP, supporting multiple transports (e.g., TCP, UDP, IPX). It includes tools for agents, queries, and management. The code is extensible and can be customized for specific needs.
- MIB and Hashing: A custom MIB is presented, allowing for file hashing on remote systems. The MIB structure includes an enterprise OID, file paths, and hash values. The provided source code demonstrates how to extend NetSNMP to support this MIB and perform file hashing.
- Tripwire Alternative: The speaker proposes using SNMP for file integrity monitoring, similar to Tripwire. By integrating with existing Network Management Systems (NMS), file hashes can be continuously monitored and changes can trigger alerts or automated responses.
- Scripting and Automation: Examples of shell scripts and Perl code are provided to demonstrate how to interact with the custom MIB and retrieve file hashes. The NetSNMP agent can execute Perl code, enabling further customization.
- C Programming: The C code for the custom MIB is discussed, focusing on the hash calculation and interaction with NetSNMP's library functions.
- Security Considerations: SNMPv3 requires the manager to know authentication and encryption passwords, making it a potential target for attacks. Properly securing the manager and limiting access to management functions is crucial.
