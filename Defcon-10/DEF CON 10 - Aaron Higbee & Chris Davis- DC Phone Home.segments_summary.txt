- Introduction: Chris Davis and Aaron Higby, security consultants, present on internal network vulnerabilities and their "180-degree hacking" concept.
- Physical Access Exploits: Gaining physical access to restricted areas, such as data centers, through creative means like ceiling tiles or social engineering, can allow unauthorized hardware to be introduced.
- Data Exfiltration: Once inside, creating a data path out is crucial. This can be done through various protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP) or exploiting proxies.
- Delivery Mechanisms: Hardware like Dreamcast, iPAC, or bootable CDs can be used to establish connections and create tunnels back to the attacker's system.
- Tunneling Techniques: VTun, SIPP, HTTP Tunnel, and Proxy Tunnel are among the tools used to create VPNs and bypass firewalls.
- Demo: Live demonstrations showcase the Dreamcast, iPAC, and bootable CD creating tunnels and accessing internal networks despite firewall restrictions.
- Remedies: Suggestions include constricting data paths, strong authentication, in-house DNS/email servers, full-mesh internet VPNs, and switchport security.
- IDS Improvements: A desire for more intelligent IDS that understands the network and can detect anomalies beyond signatures is expressed.
- Wireless and Cellular Options: The potential for using wireless access points or GSM cellular modems for remote access is discussed.
