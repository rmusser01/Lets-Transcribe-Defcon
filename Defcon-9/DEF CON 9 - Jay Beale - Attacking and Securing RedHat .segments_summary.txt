- **Introduction**: The speaker congratulates "Rainforest Puppy" on their engagement to "Zobe Kitten" and introduces the topic of Bastille Linux, a hardening script for Linux and Unix designed to enhance system security.
- **VMware Issue**: The speaker mentions a VMware problem that prevented the planned attack and defense demo, but assures the audience that a Q&A session will be held instead.
- **Bastille Linux Overview**: Bastille Linux aims to make it harder for unauthorized individuals to access and exploit vulnerabilities in a system. It is not a kernel hack or a new operating system but a script that helps set better configurations and defaults than those provided by vendors.
- **Vendor Defaults**: The speaker criticizes vendors for prioritizing ease of use over security in their default configurations, leaving users vulnerable to attacks.
- **Why Security Matters**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of security, noting that systems are often targeted by skilled hackers or "script kitties" who scan for and exploit vulnerabilities.
- **How Bastille Works**: Bastille minimizes points of entry, restricts access to programs, and prevents privilege escalation. It also educates users about security risks and provides alternatives to insecure practices.
- **Effectiveness**: The speaker highlights how Bastille helped users dodge or contain several high-profile exploits in Red Hat 6, including vulnerabilities in Bind, WooFTPD, User Helper, LPD, Sendmail, Dump/Restore, GPM, and others.
- **Adoption and Development**: Bastille has been adopted by companies like SGI, Mandrake Soft, and HP, and is being ported to other platforms like HPUX and Solaris. The speaker invites users to contribute by writing modules, testing, providing feedback, and suggesting improvements.
- **Features and Functionality**: Bastille includes an X configurator, an undo feature, and extensive explanations for each question. It creates a policy file and allows users to push configurations across multiple systems. The speaker also addresses questions about per-interface configuration, firewall capabilities, backup capabilities, and relative threat levels.
- **Future Plans**: The speaker mentions plans to add Samba configuration, file integrity checking, and support for the 2.4 kernel's improved firewalling capabilities. They also encourage users and developers to get involved and provide suggestions or contributions to the project.
