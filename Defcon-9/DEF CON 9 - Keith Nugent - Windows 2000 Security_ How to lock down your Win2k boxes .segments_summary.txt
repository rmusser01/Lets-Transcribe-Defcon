- The speaker, Keith Nugent, is a trainer who teaches people how to set up and secure Windows 2000, NT, and Cisco. He emphasizes that he does not work for Microsoft and that his talk reflects his personal opinions and experiences.
- Windows 2000, by default, is not a secure operating system. It is necessary to adjust settings and permissions to enhance security.
- NTFS (New Technology File System) is a file system that provides more advanced security features than its predecessor, FAT (File Allocation Table). NTFS allows for more granular control over file and folder permissions.
- By default, Windows 2000 gives "Everyone" full control over almost every file on the operating system, which is a security risk. It is recommended to remove this permission and grant access only to specific users or groups, such as "Authenticated Users."
- The speaker explains the difference between "Allow" and "Deny" permissions, and how they interact with each other.
- The speaker discusses the importance of using NTFS to set permissions effectively and demonstrates how to modify permissions for files and folders.
- Default security settings in Windows 2000 are lax and need to be strengthened. Password policies, account lockout policies, and Kerberos policies are not defined or disabled by default.
- Security templates can be used to enhance security settings. Microsoft provides basic templates, but users can also create custom templates by modifying existing ones or creating new ones from scratch.
- The speaker explains the concept of Group Policy in Windows 2000 and how it affects security settings. Group Policy settings are applied in a specific order, with local security settings being overridden by domain-level settings.
- The speaker demonstrates how to use the Group Policy Editor to configure security settings, such as account policies, local policies, and security options.
- The speaker discusses the use of Restricted Groups to control group membership and prevent unauthorized changes.
- The speaker explains the concept of IPSEC (Internet Protocol Security) and how it can be used to secure network communications. He also mentions the different IPSEC policies available and how they work.
- The speaker answers various questions from the audience, including topics such as anonymous access restrictions, command-line tools for group policy modification, and best practices for hardware and application compatibility with Windows 2000.
- The speaker recommends resources for further learning, such as Mark Minasi's book "Mastering Windows 2000 Server" and his website, Manasi.com.
