- Introduction: Robert Muncie, a security engineer, presents a condensed version of a seminar he attended at Cisco's Networkers event. The focus is on securing routers and networks.
- Security Principles: There is no perfect solution, and security professionals often feel outnumbered. The goal is to make it difficult to obtain network information and gain unauthorized access. A typical network hack involves reconnaissance, initial access, and privilege escalation.
- Turning Off Unnecessary Services: Disabling services like echo, finger, remote execution, and file copy improves security. Cisco's iOS 12 and later automatically disable some of these services.
- Restricting Access: Limiting IP-directed broadcasts and source routing options enhances security. Symmetric routing environments benefit from Unicast RPF. Regular iOS updates are crucial.
- Access Control: An access list can prevent unauthorized telnet access to routers. Logging is essential for security audits and incident investigations. Restricting NTP and CDP improves security.
- Authentication: Using "enable secret" with MD5 hashing instead of "enable password" is recommended. Privilege levels can restrict access for certain users. Physical access to routers should be tightly controlled.
- Auditing Login Attempts: IP accounting and logging can track login attempts. One-time passwords or SSH can enhance security for remote access.
- Preventing Spoofing: Access lists and IP Verify Unicast RPF can prevent internal IP addresses from being spoofed.
- DoS Protection: Limiting ping responses and TCP SYN packets can mitigate denial-of-service attacks.
- NAT: Network Address Translation (NAT) hides internal network structure and facilitates internet usage control. Specific servers may require static NAT entries.
- Firewall and IDS Feature Sets: Cisco offers firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS) feature sets for routers. The firewall set provides basic protection, while the IDS set analyzes packets for potential threats.
- Branch Office Connection: Encryption and pre-shared keys secure connections between branch offices. ISDN and dial-up connections require additional configuration. TED simplifies key management for large deployments.
- Summary: Key security recommendations include disabling unnecessary services, strong authentication, deploying firewalls, intrusion detection, and logging.
