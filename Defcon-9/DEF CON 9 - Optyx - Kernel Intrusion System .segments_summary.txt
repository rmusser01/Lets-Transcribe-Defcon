- Optex demonstrates KISS, a remote control agent with kernel-level capabilities designed for Linux 2.2 and 2.4.
- KISS allows configuration of both client and server, including setting passwords, install directories, and binary files.
- It offers features such as hiding and unhiding processes, files, directories, and network connections, as well as executing processes remotely.
- The communication between client and server is encrypted and can be spoofed, making it difficult to detect.
- KISS also provides a plugin interface for loading and executing additional functionality, such as disabling kernel-based IDS systems.
- Anti-KISS capabilities are mentioned, suggesting it can be used for defensive purposes or as a security product.
- Detection methods for KISS are discussed, including using K-Stat or analyzing file sizes and hidden files on the hard drive.
- Optex provides a website for downloading KISS and related tools, with a focus on educational purposes and improving system security.
