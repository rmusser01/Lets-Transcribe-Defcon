    <li>Intrusion detection is a process, not a product, that involves detecting attempted break-ins, anomalous behavior, and system misuse.</li>
    <li>It includes host-based and network-based monitoring, recording, notifying, reacting, and archiving.</li>
    <li>Intrusion detection is not a fix-all, a firewall, or a perfect system; it complements existing security controls.</li>
    <li>It operates in near real-time, can be used to check and balance security configurations, and helps adapt to changes and ad-hoc security needs.</li>
    <li>Types of intrusion detection systems include misuse-based (using attack signatures) and anomaly detection (looking for unusual activity).</li>
    <li>Deployment methods include network node-based, network-based, and host-based intrusion detection.</li>
    <li>Pros and cons of each deployment method are discussed, considering bandwidth, scalability, and system impact.</li>
    <li>Architecture variations include stand-alone, distributed, and managed environments.</li>
    <li>Bandwidth, scalability, and network fingerprinting are architecture concerns for network-based intrusion detection.</li>
    <li>Deployment locations include external, internal, technical network, critical network segments, and public services networks.</li>
    <li>NIC configuration for network-based intrusion detection involves dual NIC with stealth interface, dual NIC without stealth, or single monitored interface.</li>
    <li>False positives, data archival, custom configuration, and attack signature creation are important considerations.</li>
    <li>Intrusion detection avoidance techniques include exploiting finite nature of attack signatures and using hex encoding or fragmented packets.</li>
    <li>Usable reporting involves providing relevant and timely reports with actionable information for different stakeholders.</li>
    <li>Incident response plans should be in place, including policies, procedures, and data forensics capabilities.</li>
    <li>Event criticality depends on security policy, operating systems, applications, and focus and exploitability of attacks.</li>
    <li>When choosing an intrusion detection product, consider robustness, cost, and ease of use.</li>
    <li>Erecting an intrusion detection lab and grilling vendors are recommended steps before implementation.</li>
