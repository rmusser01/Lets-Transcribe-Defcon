- The speaker, Jason Scott, recounts his experience of being sued by his former employer, HarvardNet, for operating a website called "HarvardNet Sucks."
- Scott left HarvardNet on bad terms due to conflicts with a colleague and management. He and a group of friends created the website as a form of protest and humor.
- Scott registered the domain name using HarvardNet's address and name, and hosted the site with a Canadian company, Easy DNS. He published content that criticized the company and its practices, including the firewall name.
- HarvardNet responded by suing Scott for $120,000, claiming he had violated his non-disclosure agreement and exposed proprietary information. They obtained a temporary restraining order against him.
- Scott hired a lawyer, Lucy Lovery, who helped him gather affidavits and build a defense. The case went to court, where Scott's lawyer presented their arguments and affidavits to the judge.
- During this time, Scott continued to operate the website and received media attention, including an interview with the Boston Herald. He also became a source for other media outlets interested in HarvardNet.
- The judge denied HarvardNet's request for a restraining order, allowing Scott to continue operating the website. However, HarvardNet dropped the case shortly after a negative column about them was published in the Boston Globe.
- Scott reflects on the experience, expressing bitterness and the realization that corporations will go to great lengths to protect their interests. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the legal system and seeking legal advice when facing similar situations.
