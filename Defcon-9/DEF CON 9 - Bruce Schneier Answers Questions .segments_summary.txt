- Bruce Schneier, a security expert and writer, discusses various topics related to computer security and cryptography at a conference.
- He starts by promoting his new book, "Secrets and Lies," which is a general security book as opposed to his previous cryptography books.
- Schneier then answers questions from the audience, covering a range of topics.
- One topic is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which Schneier believes is a sham and does not provide adequate security. He recommends reading his paper, "10 Risks of PKI," which outlines the issues with PKI in detail.
- Another topic is the detection and response to security threats, especially from insiders. Schneier suggests that surveillance and monitoring can help catch intruders, but it's important to balance security with trust and privacy.
- Schneier also discusses the complexities of creating secure electronic voting systems and the challenges of ensuring both security and auditability.
- He emphasizes the importance of peer review in technical writing and how it helps improve the quality of his books and essays.
- Schneier expresses concern about the increasing complexity of software and believes it is making things worse for security. He predicts that we will see more large-scale system failures due to this complexity.
- The discussion turns to digital content protection, such as SDMI (Secure Digital Music Initiative), and Schneier's belief that these measures won't work and hurt computer security in general. He suggests alternative business models that align with the nature of digital content rather than trying to control it.
- Schneier also talks about his encryption algorithm, "Solitaire," which was featured in Neal Stephenson's novel "Cryptonomicon." He mentions a bias in the output and plans to release an updated version.
- There is an interruption to address issues of attendee behavior and the importance of respecting the hotel and its staff.
- Schneier then answers more questions, including the role of laws and enforcement in cyberspace, the challenges of international jurisdiction, and the need for technology-invariant laws.
- He concludes by emphasizing the complexity of creating global internet laws and the potential for a lowest common denominator approach that restricts freedom.
