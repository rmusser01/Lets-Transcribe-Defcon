- Raven Alder presents a Perl script, "Eyeball," for tracking denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks through ISP backbones.
- DoS/DDoS attacks can involve one or two clients with spoofed IP addresses or a large number of legitimate IP addresses.
- The Eyeball script improves upon MCI's DOS tracker by monitoring multiple IP addresses simultaneously.
- Eyeball is open-source and available on SourceForge; it currently works on Cisco platforms and requires a Perl environment.
- Eyeball automates the manual process of logging into routers and creating access lists to track down the source of DoS/DDoS attacks.
- Alder provides instructions on setting up Eyeball, including creating router access files, setting environment variables, and specifying valid routers.
- Eyeball supports multi-homed customers and BGP routing but does not block attack traffic or differentiate between good and bad traffic.
- Alder discusses potential issues with fast switching, router performance, and large-scale attacks, and encourages feedback and suggestions for improvement.
