- Introduction: The speaker introduces the topic of ICMP and addresses potential concerns about its relevance. He assures the audience that his tool, X-Prob, uses a small number of packets and is therefore efficient and effective.
- X-Prob Tool: X-Prob is a new open-source OS fingerprinting tool released at Black Hat. It was developed based on the speaker's research on active OS fingerprinting systems. The tool is simple, fast, and efficient, and future versions will include artificial intelligence and failover mechanisms.
- OS Fingerprinting Techniques: The speaker explains the logic behind X-Prob's OS fingerprinting, which involves sending a UDP datagram to a closed UDP port and analyzing the ICMP error message. He demonstrates how this technique can be used to identify various operating systems, including Linux, Cisco routers, and Windows-based systems.
- Real-World Examples: The speaker provides examples of using X-Prob to identify the OS of popular websites, including Chinese websites like People's Daily, Beijing microphone stores, and China's Foreign Office. He compares the results with NMAP scans to highlight the efficiency of X-Prob.
- Advantages of X-Prob: The speaker emphasizes the advantages of using X-Prob over other OS fingerprinting tools. He mentions the accuracy, speed, and stealth of X-Prob, which can identify an OS with just a few packets. He also discusses the potential for combining OS fingerprinting with exploitation to reduce the number of packets required.
- Future Improvements: The speaker outlines future improvements for X-Prob, including adding more firewall checks, enhancing the logic, implementing a fingerprinting database, and incorporating failover mechanisms and artificial intelligence.
- Acknowledgments: The speaker thanks various individuals and organizations for their contributions to the development of X-Prob, including Fyodor Yurrachin, Simple Nomad, and Todd Sabin.
