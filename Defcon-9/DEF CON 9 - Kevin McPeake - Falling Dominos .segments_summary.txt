- Lotus Notes is a widely-used groupware platform with strong security features, but there are still some vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.
- The stored forms feature in Lotus Notes can be exploited to execute malicious code and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- The execution control list (ECL) in Lotus Notes is meant to prevent potentially hostile code from running, but it can be bypassed using certain techniques.
- The password hashes in Lotus Notes are not salted, which makes it easier for attackers to brute-force passwords.
- The access control list (ACL) in Lotus Notes can be manipulated to gain unauthorized access to databases and servers.
- The URL language in Domino servers is powerful but can be exploited to retrieve unintended content and modify databases.
- Server ID files should be protected with passwords and stored in secure locations to prevent unauthorized access.
- Third-party tools and scripts can be used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in Lotus Notes and Domino servers.
- Workarounds and best practices exist to mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities, but many organizations are not implementing them.
