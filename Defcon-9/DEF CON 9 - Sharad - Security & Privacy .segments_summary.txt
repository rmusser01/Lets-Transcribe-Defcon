- **Human and Social Engineering:**
  - Exploiting human vulnerabilities, such as lack of awareness or trustworthiness, to gain unauthorized access. Examples include posing as someone else, tricking users into revealing sensitive information, or taking advantage of disgruntled employees.
- **Programmable Dangers:**
  - Viruses, worms, trojans, and other malicious software can cause significant damage to organizations. Viruses and worms can spread easily through email or file sharing, while trojans pretend to be useful but contain harmful code.
  - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks prevent normal functioning by overwhelming servers, networks, or hosts with traffic. Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks use multiple launch points, making them harder to defend against.
  - Sniffing involves intercepting network traffic to gather sensitive information like passwords, emails, or credit card numbers. It can be difficult to detect and affects network traffic analysis.
- **Spoofing:**
  - IP spoofing involves forging the source IP address of packets to impersonate another machine. It can be used for DoS attacks, connection killing, or hijacking active connections.
  - Web spoofing creates a false web environment to deceive users and influence their security-relevant decisions. It relies on contextual cues and can be enhanced with JavaScript to make the illusion more convincing.
- **Countermeasures:**
  - User awareness and education are critical. Organizations should set clear policies, enforce strong password practices, and regularly update software to patch vulnerabilities.
  - Use secure protocols like SSH and avoid clear text programs like telnet. Regularly review and update firewall configurations to adapt to evolving threats.
