- Introduction: Bill Tofoya, an ex-FBI agent, discusses his experience profiling criminals and his work on the Unabomber case. He explains the purpose of criminal investigative analysis (psychological profiling) and its development within the FBI.
- Unabomber Case: Tofoya provides a brief history of the Unabomber's bombings and the development of the case, including the creation of a task force and the involvement of the FBI, Postal Service, and Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. He mentions his role in interviewing victims and creating a profile.
- Victimology: Tofoya explains the concept of victimology, which examines the relationship between the victim and the criminal. He describes his efforts to find a link between the Unabomber's victims but finds their only common characteristic was their use of computers.
- Profile Discrepancy: Tofoya discusses the discrepancy between the first profile created in 1985 and his profile from 1993. He attributes the difference to the availability of more information and data over time. He also mentions the controversy surrounding the profiles and the FBI's initial skepticism of his findings.
- Neurotechnology and Behavioral Patterns: Tofoya explores the potential of neurotechnology and neurolinguistic analysis in identifying individuals through their writing style, keyboard strokes, and naming conventions. He believes these tools can be used to identify serious criminals while also benefiting the hacking community.
- Evidence in Online Crimes: Tofoya addresses the question of evidence availability in online crimes, suggesting that investigators often overlook relevant evidence due to a lack of understanding. He emphasizes the importance of proper evidence processing.
- Scholarship and Training Opportunities: Tofoya mentions scholarship and training opportunities offered by the federal government, such as the Cyber Defenders Program, to encourage students to pursue education in computer forensics and related fields. He provides a list of universities participating in these programs.
- Profiling Accuracy and Concerns: Tofoya acknowledges the potential for profiling to be overgeneralized and impact individuals' guilt or innocence. He attributes the discrepancy between the Unabomber profiles to advancements in technology and a change in mindset.
- Profiling Hackers: In response to a question, Tofoya states that he is unaware of any studies specifically profiling hackers but mentions some universities with related research interests. He believes law enforcement's use of profiling in computer crimes is limited.
- Automated Systems and Profiling: Tofoya discusses the possibility of automated systems tripping up profiling algorithms and mentions past work on an expert system that showed promising results but lacked further development.
- Honeypots and Profiling: Tofoya suggests that law enforcement likely continues to use honeypots as a successful tool but cannot comment on its extent since his retirement.
- Cultural and Regional Differences: Tofoya acknowledges cultural and regional differences in behavioral patterns and mentions ongoing research in England, Italy, and France to account for these variations in profiling.
- Impact of Second Profile on Kaczynski's Arrest: Tofoya clarifies that neither profile directly contributed to Kaczynski's arrest and conviction. The publication of the manifesto and its recognition by Kaczynski's family led to his eventual capture.
- Profiling in Cyber Attacks: Tofoya addresses the challenge of attributing cyber attacks to specific countries or organizations and suggests that profiling could be used to analyze packet origins and node information.
- Conclusion: Tofoya expresses his interest in engaging with the audience on these topics and learning more about their work. He encourages ethical behavior and contributions to the community.
